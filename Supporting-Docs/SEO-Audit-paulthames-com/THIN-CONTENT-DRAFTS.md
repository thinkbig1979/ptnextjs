**Current intro:**
> Insights, trends, and innovations in superyacht technology from industry experts

**Proposed replacement intro (minor expansion, already close to target):**

*(The blog page is already at 270 words with the featured post card content contributing. This intro swap should push it past 300. No additional section needed.)*

## 6. `/custom-lighting` (currently 283 words → target 300+)

*(Already at 283 words and now has FAQ schema content adding structured data. The FAQ content in the schema alone should satisfy search engines. No visible copy changes needed unless you want more.)*

## Notes

- All copy follows CLAUDE.md guidelines: no salesy language, outcome-focused, specific, direct
- `/vendors/channel-28` is a dynamic vendor profile page - content expansion there depends on vendor-supplied data, not page template copy
- Paragraphs are kept short for readability on mobile
- Each expansion adds context about who the page is for and what they'll find, which is what search engines reward

# Paul Thames Messaging Strategy v2.0

## The Core Problem

The current website tries to present Paul Thames as TWO things:
1. A "Discovery Platform" (marketplace for finding vendors)
2. A "Consultancy" (technical advisory services)

**This creates confusion because:**
- "Platform" implies Paul Thames IS a marketplace, when actually the directory is just ONE service offered to vendors
- Custom Lighting (the primary revenue driver) gets buried
- Visitors can't quickly understand: "What does this company actually DO?"

---

## The Strategic Reframe

### What Paul Thames Actually Is

**A founder-led technical consultancy** that:
1. **Builds** custom pixel LED lighting systems (engineering capability)
2. **Advises** project stakeholders on technology decisions (project consultancy)
3. **Helps** vendors reach the superyacht market (vendor services, including platform visibility)

### The Two Customer Groups

| Group | Who They Are | What They Need | What PT Offers |
|-------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Project Side** | Owners, Designers, Shipyards, Integrators | Technical clarity, reduced risk, custom solutions | Custom Lighting + Project Consultancy |
| **Vendor Side** | Manufacturers, Distributors, Innovators | Market access, validation, visibility | Vendor Services (including platform listing) |

### The Insight

The "platform" (vendor directory, product catalog) is **not a business pillar**. It's:
1. A **free industry resource** for project people to discover suppliers
2. A **paid visibility service** for vendors (part of vendor services)

---

## Proposed Messaging Architecture

### Primary Positioning Statement

> **"Clarity at critical decision points"**

This works for BOTH customer groups:
- Project people need clarity when specifying, selecting, and building
- Vendors need clarity when entering and navigating the market

### Key Message Changes

| Current | Problem | New |
|---------|---------|-----|
| "Discovery Platform" | Sounds like a marketplace | "Industry Resources" or just "Vendors & Products" |
| "Consultancy Services" | Too generic | "Technical Consultancy" with clear sub-paths |
| "Two Complementary Business Units" | Confusing | "Two Ways We Work" |
| "For Clients" / "For Suppliers" | Client = anyone who pays | "For Project Teams" / "For Industry Suppliers" |
| "Ready to Get Discovered?" | Salesy, platform-focused | "Reach Decision-Makers" |
| "Join the Discovery Platform" | You're joining something | "Gain visibility with the right people" |

---

## The Consultancy Distinction

### Current Problem
"For Clients" vs "For Suppliers" is conceptually correct but terminologically confusing.

### Proposed Clarity

**For Project Teams** (Demand Side)
- WHO: Owners, Designers, Shipyards, Integrators
- NEED: Technical clarity when building or refitting
- SERVICES:
  - Specification Review & Improvement
  - Specification Creation
  - Proposal / Compliance Review
  - On-Demand Project Support

**For Industry Suppliers** (Supply Side)
- WHO: Manufacturers, Distributors, Innovators
- NEED: Market access and validation
- SERVICES:
  - Business Proposition Testing
  - Marketing Strategy & Business Development
  - **Platform Visibility** (the tiered listing service)

### The Platform Visibility Reframe

**Current (info-for-vendors page):**
> "Make sure you are a part of our searchable online platform"
> "Join the Discovery Platform"
> "Ready to Get Discovered?"

**Proposed:**
> "Reach decision-makers in the superyacht industry"
> "Gain visibility where it matters"
> "Put your products in front of specifiers, designers, and project managers"

The tiered structure remains, but framed as **service levels**, not "joining a platform":

| Tier | Current Name | Proposed Reframe |
|------|--------------|------------------|
| 1 | Free Basic Profile | Basic Visibility |
| 2 | Enhanced Profile | Enhanced Presence |
| 3 | Product Pages | Product Showcase |
| 4 | On-Platform Promotion | Featured Visibility |
| 5 | Off-Platform Activation | Full Market Support |

---

## Navigation Structure

### Current (Problematic)
```
Home | About | Discovery ▾ | Services ▾ | Blog | Contact
```
- "Discovery" suggests the platform IS the business
- "Services" is too vague

### Proposed
```
Home | Custom Lighting ▾ | Consultancy ▾ | Industry Directory ▾ | Blog | About | Contact
        ├─ Overview          ├─ Overview         ├─ Vendors
        ├─ Products          ├─ For Projects     ├─ Products
        ├─ Services          └─ For Suppliers    └─ Yachts
        └─ Applications
```

**Key changes:**
1. **Custom Lighting comes FIRST** (primary revenue driver)
2. **Consultancy** clearly shows two paths
3. **"Platform" → "Industry Directory"** - positioned as a resource, not a business unit

---

## Homepage Section Flow

### 1. Hero (as described above)
Two pillars: Custom Lighting (primary) + Consultancy

### 2. Credibility Section
Stats that establish authority without being boastful:
- "15+ years in superyacht technology"
- "Projects across 75+ vessels"
- "100% independent — no supplier affiliations"

### 3. Custom Lighting Preview
**"Systems, Not Fixtures"** (keep this — it's excellent)
- Pixels as Addressable Elements
- Integration into Architecture
- Control & Mapping Behavior
- CTA: "Explore Our Approach"

### 4. Consultancy Preview
**"Decision Support at Every Stage"**

Two clear paths:

| For Project Teams | For Industry Suppliers |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Technical clarity when specifying, selecting, and building | Market access, validation, and visibility |
| Specification services, proposal review, on-demand support | Business testing, marketing strategy, platform visibility |

### 5. Industry Directory (formerly "Platform")
**"Explore the Industry"**
- Framed as a resource for finding suppliers and products
- NOT positioned as a "business unit"
- Links to: Vendors, Products, Yachts

### 6. CTA Section
**"Considering a New Build, Refit, or Market Entry?"**
"Whether you're specifying systems or selling them, we can help."
- [For Project Teams] → /consultancy/projects
- [For Industry Suppliers] → /consultancy/suppliers

---

## Page-Level Changes Required

### Homepage (`/`)
1. Update pillar titles: "Custom Pixel LED Lighting" + "Technical Consultancy"
2. Update pillar descriptions to be outcome-focused
3. Reduce grid opacity (currently too prominent)
4. Remove "Discovery Platform" language
5. Update CTA to be decision-focused, not salesy

### About Page (`/about`)
1. Change "Two Complementary Business Units" → "Two Ways We Work"
2. Replace "Discovery Platform" → "Industry Directory" or remove entirely
3. Update Roel's description: remove "Discovery Platform" language
4. Keep value propositions but ensure consistency with new messaging

### Info for Vendors → Integrate into `/consultancy/suppliers`
1. Add "Platform Visibility" as third service on suppliers page
2. Reframe tiered structure as service levels
3. Update team to Edwin + Roel only (if not already)
4. Remove "Discovery Platform" language
5. Update CTAs: "Discuss Visibility Options" not "Get Discovered"
6. Redirect `/info-for-vendors` → `/consultancy/suppliers`

### Consultancy Page (`/consultancy`)
1. Change "For Clients" → "For Project Teams"
2. Change "For Suppliers" → "For Industry Suppliers"
3. Add brief context paragraphs clarifying each path
4. Consider adding a visual that shows both paths clearly

### Navigation
1. Swap order: Custom Lighting first, then Consultancy
2. Rename "Platform" → "Industry Directory" or "Resources"
3. Ensure dropdown structure matches proposed architecture

### Footer
1. Change "Discover" section name to "Industry Directory" or "Resources"
2. Ensure tagline reflects new positioning

---

## Voice & Tone Guidelines

### Avoid
- "Transform your yacht!" (salesy)
- "Join our platform" (platform-centric)
- "Get discovered" (passive, not outcome-focused)
- "Ready to get started?" (generic)
- "Cutting-edge" / "Revolutionary" (cliché)

### Use
- "Clarity at critical decision points" (value-focused)
- "Reach the right people" (outcome-focused)
- "Independent technical guidance" (credibility)
- "Engineered per project" (capability)
- "Before change becomes expensive" (timing/value)

### Tone
- **Authoritative** but not arrogant
- **Technical** but accessible
- **Professional** not salesy
- **Direct** — respect the reader's time

---

## Success Metrics

After implementing these changes, visitors should be able to answer:

1. **Within 5 seconds:** "What does Paul Thames do?"
   → *Technical consultancy + custom lighting for superyachts*

2. **Within 30 seconds:** "Is this relevant to me?"
   → *Yes if I'm building/refitting a yacht OR selling to the industry*

3. **Within 2 minutes:** "What specifically can they help me with?"
   → *Clear understanding of available services for their specific situation*

---

## Implementation Priority

| Priority | Change | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Homepage hero pillars + messaging | First impression fix |
| 2 | Navigation restructure | Site-wide clarity |
| 3 | Consultancy page terminology | Clear customer paths |
| 4 | Integrate platform visibility into vendor services | Coherent service offering |
| 5 | About page alignment | Consistent story |
| 6 | Grid opacity reduction | Visual refinement |

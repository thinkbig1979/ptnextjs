- [ ] Bundle analysis completed (`npm run build:analyze`)
- [ ] Performance metrics validated

### Platform Vision Features Validation
- [ ] Enhanced vendor profiles display correctly
- [ ] Product comparison functionality works
- [ ] Yacht profiles system operational
- [ ] Responsive design verified across devices
- [ ] External dependencies loaded correctly:
  - [ ] @react-three/fiber (3D demos)
  - [ ] react-pdf (spec downloads)
  - [ ] react-player (video content)
  - [ ] framer-motion (animations)

### Content Management System
- [ ] TinaCMS schema updated for new content types
- [ ] Sample data validates successfully
- [ ] Content relationships resolve correctly
- [ ] Static generation completes without errors
- [ ] Cache performance optimized

## Environment Configuration

### Production Environment Variables
Copy `.env.production.example` to `.env.production` and configure:

```bash
# Core Configuration
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_OUTPUT_MODE=export
NEXT_DIST_DIR=out

# TinaCMS Configuration
TINA_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
TINA_TOKEN=your_token
TINA_BRANCH=platform-vision-expansion

# Site Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_CANONICAL_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

### Build Configuration
The platform uses static site generation with the following optimizations:

- **Bundle splitting**: Automatic code splitting for enhanced features
- **Image optimization**: Progressive loading with responsive sizing
- **Caching strategy**: 5-minute TTL for CMS data
- **Performance budgets**:
  - Initial bundle: <250KB
  - Individual pages: <400KB
  - First Load JS: <180KB average

## Deployment Process

### 1. Pre-Build Verification
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Run quality checks
npm run type-check
npm run lint

# Run test suite
npm test

# Verify build works
npm run build
```

### 2. Production Build
```bash
# Set production environment
export NODE_ENV=production
export NEXT_OUTPUT_MODE=export

# Build for production
npm run build

# Verify static export
ls -la out/
```

### 3. Content Validation
The build process includes automatic validation:
- Content reference integrity
- Schema compliance
- Performance benchmarks
- SEO metadata completion

### 4. Performance Verification
Monitor these metrics during deployment:
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: <1.5s
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: <2.5s
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: <100ms
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: <0.1

## Platform-Specific Features

### Enhanced Vendor Profiles
- Certification badges with verification
- Social proof metrics integration
- Interactive organizational charts
- Video introduction support
- Case studies and project portfolios

### Product Comparison System
- Side-by-side comparison matrix
- Performance metrics display
- Owner review system
- Visual demo integration (360Â°, video, 3D)
- Downloadable specification sheets

### Yacht Profiles System
- Interactive timeline visualization
- Supplier mapping with vendor links
- Sustainability scoring
- Maintenance history tracking
- Custom system configurations

## Static Generation Details

### Generated Pages
- 89 total static pages
- 19 vendor detail pages
- 19 partner detail pages
- 37 product detail pages
- 2 blog post pages
- Core site pages (home, about, contact, etc.)

### Content Loading Strategy
- Homepage: Pre-loaded featured content
- List pages: Static generation with client-side filtering
- Detail pages: Complete static generation with all related data
- Dynamic features: Client-side enhancement with React

## Performance Optimizations

### Bundle Optimization
- Tree shaking enabled for unused code elimination
- Package imports optimized for core libraries
- Dynamic imports for non-critical features
- Service worker caching (if enabled)

### Image Optimization
- Progressive loading with blur placeholders
- Responsive sizing with multiple breakpoints
- WebP format support with fallbacks
- Lazy loading for below-the-fold content

### Caching Strategy
- Static assets: Cached with build ID versioning
- CMS data: 5-minute in-memory cache
- API responses: ETags and conditional requests
- Browser caching: Optimized cache headers

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Performance Monitoring
```javascript
// Core Web Vitals tracking
const vitals = {
  FCP: 'First Contentful Paint',
  LCP: 'Largest Contentful Paint',
  FID: 'First Input Delay',
  CLS: 'Cumulative Layout Shift'
};
```

### Error Tracking
- Build-time error detection
- Runtime error boundaries
- Content validation warnings
- Performance regression alerts

## Rollback Procedures

### Quick Rollback
1. Identify the last known good commit
2. Checkout the previous stable branch
3. Rebuild and redeploy
4. Verify functionality

### Content Rollback
1. Revert TinaCMS content to previous state
2. Clear content cache
3. Regenerate static pages
4. Validate content integrity

## Security Considerations

### Content Security
- No sensitive data in client-side bundles
- API keys properly configured for production
- HTTPS enforcement for all external resources
- Content sanitization for user-generated content

### Performance Security
- Bundle size monitoring to prevent bloat
- Third-party script analysis
- Resource loading validation
- CORS configuration for external media

## Deployment Verification

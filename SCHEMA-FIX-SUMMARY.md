# Payload CMS Schema Fix - Partner Field Addition

**Date:** October 18, 2025
**Issue:** Schema mismatch warning on every dev server startup
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

## Problem Summary

Every time the dev server started, Payload CMS displayed this warning:

```
⚠️  Warnings detected during schema push:
· You're about to delete partner column in vendors table with 19 items
DATA LOSS WARNING: Possible data loss detected if schema is pushed.
Accept warnings and push schema to database? › (y/N)
```

## Root Cause

**Database vs Code Mismatch:**
- ✅ **Database had:** A `partner` column (boolean) with real data (5 vendors marked as partners)
- ❌ **Payload config had:** NO `partner` field defined in Vendors.ts
- ✅ **Frontend used:** `product.vendor.partner` for filtering products

**How it happened:**
1. Frontend code was implemented to filter products by partner status (Oct 17, 2025)
2. Partner data was populated in the database manually or through migration
3. The `partner` field was never added to the Payload schema definition
4. Payload's auto-sync detected the orphaned column and wanted to delete it

## Data Verification

### TinaCMS Migration Status
✅ **Migration Complete:**
- TinaCMS: 17 vendors → Payload: 17 vendors ✓
- TinaCMS: 35 products → Payload: 35 products ✓

### Partner Data in Database
5 vendors marked as partners:
1. Alfa Laval (ID: 1)
2. Furuno Electric Co. (ID: 6)
3. Lumishore (ID: 8)
4. OceanLED (ID: 12)
5. Yanmar Marine (ID: 17)

### Test/Placeholder Data Found
2 test vendors (should be deleted from admin panel):
- "UI Pending 1760711705414" (ID: 18)
- "Pending Company 1760711704175" (ID: 19)

## Solution Implemented

**Added `partner` field to Vendors collection schema** (`payload/collections/Vendors.ts` line 1016-1028):

```typescript
{
  name: 'partner',
  type: 'checkbox',
  defaultValue: false,
  admin: {
    position: 'sidebar',
    description: 'Mark as featured partner (distinct from regular vendor)',
  },
  access: {
    // @ts-expect-error - Payload CMS 3.x field-level access type compatibility
    update: isAdmin, // Only admins can mark as partner
  },
},
```

## Field Specifications

- **Type:** Boolean (checkbox)
- **Default:** `false`
- **Position:** Sidebar (alongside `featured` and `published`)
- **Access Control:** Admin-only (vendors cannot self-promote to partner status)
- **Description:** "Mark as featured partner (distinct from regular vendor)"

## Frontend Integration

The `partner` field is already integrated in the frontend:

**File:** `app/components/products-client.tsx`

**Usage:** Filters products by partner/vendor view:
```typescript
// Apply vendor view filter (partners only vs all vendors)
if (vendorView === "partners") {
  filtered = filtered.filter(product => {
    // Check if product has vendor object with partner flag
    if (product?.vendor?.partner === true) {
      return true;
    }
    // Fallback to lookup table
    const vendorId = product?.vendorId || product?.partnerId;
    if (!vendorId) return false;
    const vendor = vendorLookup[vendorId];
    return vendor?.partner === true;
  });
}
```

## Result

✅ **Schema mismatch resolved**
✅ **No more data loss warnings**
✅ **Partner field now properly defined in schema**
✅ **Existing partner data preserved**
✅ **Frontend filtering continues to work**
✅ **Admin panel accessible at `/admin`**

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Delete test vendors** from Payload admin:
   - Navigate to `/admin/collections/vendors`
   - Delete "UI Pending 1760711705414"
   - Delete "Pending Company 1760711704175"

2. **Verify partner status** for all vendors in admin panel

3. **Consider adding partner field** to vendor list view:
   Update `defaultColumns` in Vendors.ts line 9:
   ```typescript
   defaultColumns: ['companyName', 'partner', 'tier', 'published', 'featured', 'createdAt'],
   ```

## Files Modified

1. `payload/collections/Vendors.ts` - Added `partner` field definition

## Testing

- ✅ Dev server starts without schema warnings
- ✅ Admin panel accessible (HTTP 308 redirect)
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ Partner filtering works on products page

## Conclusion

The schema mismatch has been resolved by adding the missing `partner` field definition to the Vendors collection schema. The field now matches the database structure and frontend implementation, eliminating the data loss warning that appeared on every server startup.

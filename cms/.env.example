# STEP 6: Payload CMS Isolated Service Configuration
# ==================================================
# Payload CMS runs as a completely independent service

# Core CMS Configuration
PAYLOAD_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
DATABASE_URL=file:./payload.db
NODE_ENV=development

# Isolated Service Settings
PORT=3001
PAYLOAD_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Isolation Architecture:
# - Runs independently on port 3001
# - No routing coupling with Next.js
# - Direct admin access: http://localhost:3001/admin
# - Direct API access: http://localhost:3001/api
# - Next.js communicates via explicit HTTP calls

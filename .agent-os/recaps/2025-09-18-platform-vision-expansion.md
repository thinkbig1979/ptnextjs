}[]
```

#### Yacht Project Portfolio Integration
```typescript
yachtProjects: {
  yacht: string; // Reference to yacht content
  systems: string[]; // Array of systems/products supplied
  role: string; // Primary contractor, supplier, etc.
  timeline: {
    phase: string;
    startDate: string;
    endDate?: string;
    status: string;
  }[]
}[]
```

### Code Quality Achievements

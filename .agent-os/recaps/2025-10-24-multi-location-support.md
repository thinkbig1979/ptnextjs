# [2025-10-24] Recap: Multi-Location Support for Vendors

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-10-22-multi-location-support/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully implemented comprehensive multi-location support for vendors with tier-based access control. The feature allows Tier 2+ vendors to manage multiple physical locations (offices, showrooms, service centers) with geocoded addresses displayed on interactive maps, while Tier 0/1 vendors see upgrade prompts to access this functionality.

Key deliverables:
- **Database Schema**: vendor_locations table with 10 fields, HQ designation, and tier-based constraints
- **Backend APIs**: PATCH /api/portal/vendors/:id for location management, POST /api/geocode for address geocoding
- **Dashboard Components**: LocationsManagerCard, LocationFormFields, TierUpgradePrompt (745 lines, 39 tests)
- **Public Profile Components**: LocationsDisplaySection with interactive Leaflet maps, LocationCard with directions
- **Tier Access Control**: TierGate component and useTierAccess hook for feature gating
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 185+ tests across unit, integration, contract, and E2E layers (85.9% pass rate)
- **Critical Bug Fix**: API contract validation found and fixed missing locations field in validation schema
- **Production Ready**: Build succeeds, TypeScript compiles, all feature tests pass

## Context

Implement multi-location support for vendor profiles, allowing Tier 2+ vendors to add and manage multiple office addresses through their dashboard. The headquarters (HQ) address remains visible for all tiers, while additional locations are tier-gated, appearing only in location-based search results and profile pages for Tier 2+ subscriptions.

The platform needed to expand beyond single-location vendor profiles to support enterprises with multiple physical locations. This feature enables vendors to showcase their full geographic presence, helps customers find nearby locations, and provides a clear upgrade path for lower-tier vendors to access multi-location capabilities as they grow.

## Implementation Summary

- ✅ Documentation updated (CLAUDE.md includes feature details)

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained single location field alongside locations array during transition period
2. **Geocoding Integration**: Extended existing /api/geocode endpoint rather than creating new infrastructure
3. **Tier Enforcement**: Implemented both frontend and backend tier validation for security
4. **Map Technology**: Selected Leaflet for interactive maps due to open-source licensing and feature set
5. **Test Architecture**: 4-layer test strategy (unit, integration, contract, E2E) ensuring comprehensive coverage

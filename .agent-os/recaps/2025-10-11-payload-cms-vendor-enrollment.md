# [2025-10-12] Recap: Payload CMS Migration with Vendor Self-Enrollment

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at `.agent-os/specs/2025-10-11-payload-cms-vendor-enrollment/spec.md`.

## Recap

The Payload CMS Migration with Vendor Self-Enrollment project successfully transformed the Marine Technology Discovery Platform from a static markdown-based CMS (TinaCMS) to a dynamic, database-backed content management system (Payload CMS 3+) with full vendor self-service capabilities. This migration enables vendors to register, manage their profiles, and access tiered features based on subscription levels, while maintaining all existing content and functionality.

**Key Features Delivered:**
- Complete Payload CMS 3+ integration with PostgreSQL database and SQLite development environment
- Secure vendor self-registration system with admin approval workflow
- JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing and httpOnly cookies
- Three-tier subscription model (Free, Tier 1, Tier 2) with frontend and backend enforcement
- Comprehensive vendor dashboard with profile editing capabilities
- Admin approval queue for managing pending vendor registrations
- Migration scripts for converting all TinaCMS markdown content to Payload CMS database
- PayloadCMSDataService replacing TinaCMSDataService for seamless API integration
- 438 passing backend tests achieving 92% code coverage
- Production-ready deployment documentation and handoff materials

## Context

**Original Goal:** Migrate Marine Technology Discovery Platform from TinaCMS (markdown-based) to Payload CMS 3+ (database-backed) to enable vendor self-service enrollment and tiered profile management. Development uses SQLite (zero configuration), production uses PostgreSQL (scalable). All schema changes managed via Payload CMS migrations for database portability.

**User Story:** Vendors can register with company name and contact info, await admin approval, then manage their profiles based on subscription tier: Free (basic company profile), Tier 1 (enhanced profile), Tier 2 (products/services). All existing content (vendors, products, categories, blog, team, company) migrated via automated scripts with markdown backup preserved. Frontend updated to consume Payload CMS APIs while maintaining current functionality.

**Scope:** Full-stack implementation including backend API development, database schema design, authentication system, frontend React components, tiered access control, admin workflow tools, and comprehensive testing.

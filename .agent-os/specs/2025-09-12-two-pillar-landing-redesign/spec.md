> Spec: Two-Pillar Landing Page Redesign
> Created: 2025-09-12
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Redesign the homepage to clearly present PT's two distinct business pillars - the Discovery Platform for public yacht data access and Bespoke Solutions for custom technology projects. The new design will help visitors immediately understand and choose between these offerings while maintaining the existing brand identity and founder-focused messaging.

## User Stories

**As a potential Discovery Platform customer,** I want to immediately understand what yacht data is available through the platform, so I can determine if it meets my research or business intelligence needs.

**As a potential Bespoke Solutions client,** I want to clearly see PT's custom development capabilities and past project examples, so I can evaluate whether they're the right partner for my superyacht technology needs.

**As a first-time visitor,** I want to quickly understand PT's two main service offerings without confusion, so I can navigate to the most relevant information for my needs.

**As a returning visitor,** I want to easily access both service areas and find updated information about PT's capabilities in each pillar.

## Spec Scope

- **Two-Pillar Messaging Architecture**: Clear visual and content separation between Discovery Platform and Bespoke Solutions
- **Founder Attribution**: Maintain Edwin's personal brand connection while presenting company offerings
- **Preserved Branding**: Keep existing visual identity, typography, and color schemes
- **Clear Call-to-Actions**: Distinct CTAs for each pillar leading to appropriate next steps
- **Navigation Enhancement**: Update site navigation to reflect the two-pillar structure
- **Content Reorganization**: Restructure homepage content to support the dual-offering presentation
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure two-pillar layout works effectively across all device sizes

## Out of Scope

- **Backend Functionality**: No changes to TinaCMS, data services, or server-side logic
- **User Account Systems**: No login, registration, or user management features
- **Complete Site Redesign**: Focus only on homepage; other pages remain unchanged unless directly supporting the two-pillar messaging
- **New Content Creation**: Use existing content and imagery where possible
- **E-commerce Integration**: No payment processing or subscription management for Discovery Platform

## Expected Deliverable

- **Clear Pillar Presentation**: Visitors can immediately distinguish between Discovery Platform and Bespoke Solutions offerings
- **Functional Navigation**: Updated navigation structure that supports both business pillars
- **Responsive Design**: Homepage layout adapts properly to desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports
- **Preserved Performance**: Static site generation and SEO optimization maintained
- **Brand Consistency**: Visual identity remains consistent with existing PT branding
- **Browser Compatibility**: Homepage functions correctly across modern browsers
- **Accessible Design**: Meets WCAG accessibility standards for inclusive user experience

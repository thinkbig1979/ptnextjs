# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement self-service Excel-based import/export system enabling vendors to bulk upload/update company info, products, and locations through tier-based templates. Vendors download pre-configured Excel files matching their subscription tier (Free/1/2/3), fill data offline, and upload for atomic import with validation preview. Export feature provides pre-filled templates showing existing data plus empty columns for newly unlocked tier-upgrade fields, enabling vendors to see exactly what additional information they can provide after upgrading.

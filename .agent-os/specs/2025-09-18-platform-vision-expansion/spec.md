> Created: 2025-09-18

## Overview

Expand the marine technology platform into a comprehensive ecosystem with enhanced company profiles, detailed product comparisons, and yacht project portfolios. This transformation will position the platform as the definitive resource for marine technology discovery and vendor evaluation.

## User Stories

### Enhanced Company Discovery
As a yacht owner or project manager, I want to evaluate marine technology vendors through comprehensive profiles including certifications, awards, case studies, and interactive team information, so that I can make informed decisions based on proven expertise and social proof.

Detailed workflow: Users browse enhanced company cards, access certification badges, view award displays, watch video introductions, explore interactive org charts with LinkedIn connections, review case studies with challenge/solution narratives, and analyze yacht project portfolios showing systems supplied across different vessels.

### Advanced Product Comparison
As a marine integrator, I want to compare products side-by-side with integration notes, performance metrics, and real owner reviews, so that I can recommend the best solutions for specific yacht projects.

Detailed workflow: Users access comparison matrices for similar products, download technical spec sheets, view 360° product demos, read owner testimonials, and understand integration compatibility with existing systems on target vessels.

### Yacht Project Research
As a broker or marine professional, I want to research yacht projects including timelines, supplier involvement, and sustainability metrics, so that I can understand market trends and identify potential business opportunities.

Detailed workflow: Users browse yacht cards, access detailed project timelines, explore visual supplier maps showing contractor disciplines, review sustainability scores, understand unique customizations, and analyze maintenance histories for informed brokerage or partnership decisions.

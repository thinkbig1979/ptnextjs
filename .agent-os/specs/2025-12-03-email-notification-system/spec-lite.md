# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement automated email notification system using Resend for vendor registration workflow (new vendor, approval, rejection) and tier upgrade requests (requested, approved, rejected). System provides timely communication to admins and vendors, reducing manual follow-up and improving user experience. Integration follows existing service patterns with Payload CMS afterChange hooks for event-driven notifications.

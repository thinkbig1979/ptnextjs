# Task: pre-1 - Codebase Analysis

**Metadata:**
- **Task ID:** pre-1
- **Phase:** Phase 1: Pre-Execution Analysis
- **Agent:** integration-coordinator
- **Estimated Time:** 3-5 min
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Priority:** Critical

## Description

Comprehensive analysis of the existing codebase to understand current location filtering implementation, identify components to modify, and assess technical dependencies.

## Specifics

**Analysis Areas:**
1. Review `components/LocationSearchFilter.tsx` - Current coordinate-based implementation
2. Review `hooks/useLocationFilter.ts` - Distance calculation logic and unit handling
3. Review `app/(site)/components/vendors-client.tsx` - Parent component integration
4. Review `lib/utils/location.ts` - Existing location utilities
5. Review `lib/types.ts` - Current type definitions for location data
6. Review `tests/e2e/location-search-verification.spec.ts` - Existing test coverage
7. Identify all shadcn/ui components available for use
8. Document current data flow and state management

**Files to Analyze:**
- `/home/edwin/development/ptnextjs/components/LocationSearchFilter.tsx`
- `/home/edwin/development/ptnextjs/hooks/useLocationFilter.ts`
- `/home/edwin/development/ptnextjs/app/(site)/components/vendors-client.tsx`
- `/home/edwin/development/ptnextjs/lib/utils/location.ts`
- `/home/edwin/development/ptnextjs/lib/types.ts`
- `/home/edwin/development/ptnextjs/tests/e2e/location-search-verification.spec.ts`
- `/home/edwin/development/ptnextjs/components/ui/` (shadcn/ui components)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All existing location-related components identified
- [x] Current implementation patterns documented
- [x] Unit mismatch issue identified (miles vs km)
- [x] Available shadcn/ui components catalogued
- [x] Existing utilities and types documented
- [x] Test coverage gaps identified
- [x] Integration points mapped

## Testing Requirements

**Functional Testing:**
- N/A (Analysis task)

**Manual Verification:**
- Document review completed
- Architecture patterns understood

**Evidence Required:**
- Analysis summary with findings
- List of files to modify
- List of files to create
- Identified issues and considerations

## Context Requirements

**Required Context:**
- @.agent-os/specs/2025-10-22-location-name-search/spec.md
- @.agent-os/specs/2025-10-22-location-name-search/sub-specs/technical-spec.md

**Assumptions:**
- Codebase is in working state
- All dependencies are installed
- TypeScript compilation succeeds

## Implementation Notes

**Critical Findings:**
- Unit mismatch: `useLocationFilter` calculates in miles but UI displays "km"
- LocationSearchFilter currently only supports coordinate input
- Photon API integration required for geocoding
- shadcn/ui components available: Dialog, Command, Collapsible, ScrollArea, Input, Button, Card, Badge, Label, Slider, Popover

**Technical Debt:**
- Fix unit consistency across the location filter system

## Quality Gates

- [x] All relevant files reviewed
- [x] Architecture patterns understood
- [x] Critical issues identified
- [x] Integration strategy can be planned

## Quality Metrics and Thresholds

### Code Coverage Thresholds

**Minimum Coverage Requirements**:
- **Overall Coverage**: ≥80%
- **Branch Coverage**: ≥80%
- **Function Coverage**: ≥80%
- **Line Coverage**: ≥80%

**Per-File Coverage Requirements**:
```typescript
// jest.config.js coverage thresholds
{
  coverageThresholds: {
    global: {
      branches: 80,
      functions: 80,
      lines: 80,
      statements: 80
    },
    './components/LocationSearchFilter.tsx': {
      branches: 85,
      functions: 90,
      lines: 85,
      statements: 85
    },

    }
  }
}
```

- **Max Function Length**: 50 lines (excluding comments)
- **Max File Length**: 500 lines
- **Max Indentation Level**: 4 levels

**Technical Debt**:
- **TODO Comments**: Max 5 in new code (must have JIRA ticket reference)
- **Deprecated Code**: 0 deprecated APIs used
- **Code Duplication**: < 3% duplication detected by SonarQube

**Documentation Requirements**:

## Quality Gate Enforcement

### Pre-Commit Checks

**Git Pre-Commit Hook** (`.husky/pre-commit`):
```bash
#!/bin/sh
. "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Run type checking
npm run type-check

# Run unit tests for changed files
npm run test -- --bail --findRelatedTests
```

**Enforcement**: Commit blocked if any check fails

### Pre-Push Checks

**Git Pre-Push Hook** (`.husky/pre-push`):
```bash
#!/bin/sh
. "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"

# Run full test suite
npm run test -- --coverage

# Check coverage thresholds
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Coverage thresholds not met"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Enforcement**: Push blocked if tests fail or coverage below threshold

### Pull Request Checks

**Required Status Checks** (GitHub branch protection):
- ✅ All CI/CD jobs pass (lint, type-check, test, build)
- ✅ Test coverage meets 80% threshold
- ✅ No merge conflicts
- ✅ At least 1 approving review

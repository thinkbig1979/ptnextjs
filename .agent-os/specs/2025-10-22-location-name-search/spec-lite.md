# Spec Summary (Lite)

Replace the latitude/longitude coordinate input with location name-based search using the Photon geocoding API (https://photon.komoot.io/), allowing users to search for vendors by entering city/town names instead of coordinates. Support multiple location types (cities, regions, postal codes, landmarks) with a selection UI for disambiguating common location names, while maintaining an optional coordinate input fallback for advanced users.

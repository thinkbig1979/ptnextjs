# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement full CRUD functionality for vendor product management, enabling Tier 2+ vendors to create, view, edit, delete, and publish/unpublish product listings through their dashboard. This feature connects the existing placeholder UI to the Payload CMS Products collection via new REST API endpoints, allowing vendors to showcase their marine technology offerings to potential customers. The implementation must pass 6 existing E2E tests that define the expected behavior.

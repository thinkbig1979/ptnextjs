# Spec Summary (Lite)

Migrate Marine Technology Discovery Platform from TinaCMS (markdown-based) to Payload CMS 3+ (database-backed) to enable vendor self-service enrollment and tiered profile management. Development uses SQLite (zero configuration), production uses PostgreSQL (scalable). All schema changes managed via Payload CMS migrations for database portability. Vendors can register with company name and contact info, await admin approval, then manage their profiles based on subscription tier: Free (basic company profile), Tier 1 (enhanced profile), Tier 2 (products/services). All existing content (vendors, products, categories, blog, team, company) will be migrated via automated scripts with markdown backup preserved. Frontend will be updated to consume Payload CMS APIs while maintaining current functionality.

## Migration Features

### 1. Data Transformation

**Vendor Migration** (lines 26-80):
```typescript
- Parses markdown frontmatter
- Transforms media paths (TinaCMS → public URLs)
- Maps partner field to vendor.partner boolean
- Sets default tier: 'free'
- Preserves services, certifications, location
- Generates slugs from filenames
```

**Product Migration** (lines 130-198):
```typescript
- Resolves vendor references
- Creates vendor-product relationships
- Transforms product images array
- Preserves specifications
- Sets published: false (requires admin approval)
```

**Category Migration** (lines 82-128):
```typescript
- Preserves name, description, icon
- Maps color codes
- Generates slugs
```

**Blog Post Migration** (lines 201-249):
```typescript
- Preserves content (markdown)
- Transforms featured images
- Maps publish dates
- Sets published: false
```

**Team Member Migration** (lines 251-299):
```typescript
- Preserves name, role, bio
- Transforms profile images
- Maps contact info (email, LinkedIn)
- Preserves display order
```

**Company Info Migration** (lines 301-347):
```typescript
- Reads from content/company/info.json
- Preserves all company metadata
- Transforms logo path
- Maps contact information
```

### 2. Error Handling

**Per-Item Error Tracking**:
- Each item wrapped in try-catch
- Errors collected in collection report
- Failed items logged with reason
- Migration continues on individual failures

**Collection-Level Error Handling**:
- Catches directory read errors
- Logs collection-level failures
- Continues with next collection

**Final Report**:
- Success count per collection
- Failed count per collection
- Detailed error messages
- Total success/failed summary

### 3. Data Integrity

**Reference Resolution**:
- Products → Vendors (slug-based lookup)
- Validates vendor exists before product creation
- Fails gracefully if vendor not found

**Media Path Transformation**:
- Converts TinaCMS media paths to public URLs
- Utility function: `transformMediaPath()`

**Slug Generation**:
- Extracts from filename or frontmatter
- Ensures URL-safe format

### 4. Backup System

**Backup Creation** (utils/backup.ts):
```typescript
- Creates timestamped backup directory
- Copies entire content/ folder
- Format: backups/backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/
- Preserves original markdown files
```

**Backup Policy**:
- Automatic by default (production migrations)
- Skip via `--skip-backup` flag (dry runs)
- Permanent retention of original files

---

## Migration Utilities

### Markdown Parser (utils/markdown-parser.ts)
```typescript
parseMarkdownDirectory(path: string): Promise<MarkdownFile[]>
- Reads all .md files in directory
- Parses frontmatter (YAML)
- Extracts content body
- Returns structured data

transformMediaPath(path: string): string
- Converts TinaCMS paths → public URLs
- Example: /uploads/image.jpg → /api/media/image.jpg

resolveReference(ref: string): string | null
- Extracts slug from markdown reference
- Example: content/vendors/company.md → company
```

### Backup Utility (utils/backup.ts)
```typescript
createBackup(source: string, dest: string): Promise<string>
- Recursively copies directory
- Creates timestamped backup folder
- Returns backup path
```

## Execution Instructions

### Development/Testing Migration

**Dry Run** (preview changes without writing to database):
```bash
npx tsx scripts/migration/migrate-all.ts --dry-run
```

**Test Migration** (write to dev database):
```bash
# Backup created automatically
npx tsx scripts/migration/migrate-all.ts
```

**Check Results**:
```bash
# View migrated data in Payload admin
open http://localhost:3000/admin

# Query database directly
sqlite3 payload.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vendors;"
sqlite3 payload.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products;"
```

### Production Migration

**Prerequisites**:
1. ✅ Payload CMS system deployed to production
2. ✅ PostgreSQL database configured and accessible
3. ✅ Environment variables set (DATABASE_URL, PAYLOAD_SECRET)
4. ✅ Scheduled maintenance window
5. ✅ Backup strategy confirmed
6. ✅ Rollback plan documented

**Production Migration Steps**:

```bash
# 1. Create pre-migration backup
cd /path/to/production/site
tar -czf content-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz content/

# 2. Run dry-run to preview
npx tsx scripts/migration/migrate-all.ts --dry-run > migration-preview.log

# 3. Review preview log
less migration-preview.log

# 4. Execute production migration (creates automatic backup)
npx tsx scripts/migration/migrate-all.ts > migration-production.log 2>&1

# 5. Verify migration report
tail -50 migration-production.log

# 6. Verify data in Payload admin
open https://yoursite.com/admin

# 7. Check database record counts
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 'vendors' as collection, COUNT(*) FROM vendors
  UNION ALL SELECT 'products', COUNT(*) FROM products
  UNION ALL SELECT 'categories', COUNT(*) FROM categories;"
```

### Rollback Procedure

If migration fails:

```bash
# 1. Check backup location
ls -la backups/

# 2. Restore from automatic backup
# (Backup created at start of migration)

# 3. Database rollback (if Payload created records)
# Truncate Payload collections
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
  TRUNCATE TABLE vendors CASCADE;
  TRUNCATE TABLE products CASCADE;
  TRUNCATE TABLE categories CASCADE;
  TRUNCATE TABLE blog_posts CASCADE;
  TRUNCATE TABLE team_members CASCADE;
  TRUNCATE TABLE company_info CASCADE;
"

# 4. Re-run migration after fixing issues
npx tsx scripts/migration/migrate-all.ts
```

## Validation Checklist

### Pre-Migration Validation
- [ ] Payload CMS system fully deployed
- [ ] Database connection tested
- [ ] Admin user created in Payload
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Dry-run executed successfully
- [ ] Backup directory has sufficient space

### Post-Migration Validation
- [ ] All record counts match source (markdown files vs database)
- [ ] Sample vendor profiles display correctly
- [ ] Sample products display with correct vendor relationships
- [ ] Media URLs resolve (images load)
- [ ] Blog posts render correctly
- [ ] Categories display properly
- [ ] Team member profiles complete
- [ ] Company info accurate

### Data Integrity Checks

**Vendor Count**:
```bash
# Source (markdown files)
ls content/vendors/*.md | wc -l

# Destination (database)
sqlite3 payload.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vendors;"
```

**Product Count**:
```bash
ls content/products/*.md | wc -l
sqlite3 payload.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products;"
```

**Vendor-Product Relationships**:
```bash
# Check for orphaned products
sqlite3 payload.db "
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products
  WHERE vendor NOT IN (SELECT id FROM vendors);
"
# Should be 0
```

**Media URLs**:
```bash
# Check for broken image paths
curl -I http://localhost:3000/uploads/sample-logo.jpg
# Should return 200 OK
```

## Expected Migration Results

### Estimated Record Counts

Based on content/ directory structure:

| Collection | Estimated Count | Notes |
|------------|----------------|-------|
| Vendors | ~15-25 | All markdown files in content/vendors/ |
| Products | ~30-50 | All markdown files in content/products/ |
| Categories | ~8-12 | Product and content categories |
| Blog Posts | ~10-20 | All posts in content/blog/posts/ |
| Team Members | ~3-5 | All files in content/team/ |
| Company Info | 1 | Single company record |

**Total Estimated Time**: 2-5 minutes (depends on database and content volume)

### Success Criteria

✅ **100% Success Rate** - All collections migrated without errors
✅ **No Data Loss** - Record counts match source
✅ **Relationships Intact** - All product-vendor links preserved
✅ **Media Accessible** - All images and assets resolve
✅ **Backup Created** - Timestamped backup in backups/ directory

## Known Issues and Limitations

### 1. Manual Approval Required

**Products**: All migrated products set to `published: false`
**Action**: Admin must review and approve each product in Payload admin

**Blog Posts**: All posts set to `published: false`
**Action**: Admin must review and publish posts

**Vendors**: Initially set to `tier: 'free'`
**Action**: Admin must upgrade vendors to tier1/tier2 as appropriate

### 2. Missing Fields

**User Relationships**: Vendors not linked to user accounts
**Resolution**: Vendors created via migration are standalone. Vendor enrollment creates user accounts.

**Product Specifications**: Complex specifications may need manual review
**Resolution**: Verify specifications array formatting

### 3. Media Path Transformation

**Assumption**: Media files already in public/ directory
**Verification**: Ensure all files in /uploads/ are accessible

### 4. Date Formatting

**Published Dates**: May need timezone adjustment
**Resolution**: Review publishedAt fields after migration

## Recommendations

### Before Production Migration

1. **Test in Staging**: Run full migration in staging environment first
2. **Content Freeze**: Prevent TinaCMS edits during migration window
3. **Database Backup**: Create full PostgreSQL dump before migration
4. **Maintenance Mode**: Put site in maintenance mode during migration
5. **Monitoring**: Have database and server monitoring active

### After Production Migration

1. **Spot Checks**: Manually review 10% of migrated content
2. **SEO Verification**: Ensure URLs and slugs match pre-migration
3. **Search Indexing**: Trigger search index rebuild if applicable
4. **Cache Warming**: Pre-warm caches for critical pages
5. **Analytics**: Monitor traffic and error rates post-migration

### Post-Migration Cleanup

1. **Keep TinaCMS Content**: Preserve original markdown files as permanent backup
2. **Document Differences**: Note any content that couldn't be migrated
3. **User Training**: Train admins on Payload CMS admin interface
4. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for Payload CMS errors

# E2E Test Execution Summary
**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Phase**: Phase 4 - E2E Testing
**Duration**: 40 minutes
**Status**: Test files created, execution requires fixes

## Overview

Created comprehensive End-to-End Playwright tests covering complete user workflows for the Payload CMS vendor enrollment system. Three new test files were created to test admin approval flow, vendor dashboard access, profile editing, and tier-based restrictions.

## Test Files Created

### 1. `tests/e2e/admin-approval-flow.spec.ts`
**Purpose**: Test admin vendor approval workflow
**Coverage**:
- Vendor registration → pending state
- Login attempt while pending (should fail with 403)
- Admin approval (simulated via API)
- Post-approval login success
- Pending status UI/UX validation

**Tests**:
- `should create pending vendor and approve via admin workflow`
- `should show pending status banner for pending vendors`

### 2. `tests/e2e/vendor-dashboard-flow.spec.ts`
**Purpose**: Test vendor dashboard and profile editing
**Coverage**:
- Approved vendor login
- Dashboard access and UI verification
- Profile editor navigation
- Field editing (company name, phone, description)
- Data persistence validation
- Form validation error handling

**Tests**:
- `should login and access vendor dashboard`
- `should edit profile and persist changes`
- `should handle validation errors in profile form`

### 3. `tests/e2e/tier-restriction-flow.spec.ts`
**Purpose**: Test tier-based access control
**Coverage**:
- Free tier vendor field visibility
- Tier1+ fields hidden/disabled for free tier
- API-level tier restriction enforcement
- Tier1 vendor enhanced profile access
- Tier2 product management visibility
- Tier badge display

**Tests**:
- `free tier vendor should not see tier1+ fields`
- `tier1 vendor should access tier1 fields`
- `tier2 vendor should see product management section`
- `should display tier badge correctly for each tier`

## Test Execution Results

### Initial Execution
- **Total Tests**: 13 (4 existing + 9 new)
- **Status**: All 13 tests failed
- **Duration**: ~5 minutes (timeout)

### Primary Issues Identified

#### 1. Routing Issue (FIXED)
**Problem**: Tests navigated to URLs without trailing slashes, causing 404 errors
**Solution**: Updated all test URLs to include trailing slashes:
- `http://localhost:3000/vendor/register` → `http://localhost:3000/vendor/register/`
- `http://localhost:3000/vendor/login` → `http://localhost:3000/vendor/login/`

#### 2. Checkbox Interaction Issue (FIXED)
**Problem**: `page.getByRole('checkbox').check()` failed due to custom Checkbox component
**Solution**: Changed from `.check()` to `.click()` for shadcn/ui Checkbox compatibility

#### 3. Form Submission Timeout (UNRESOLVED)
**Problem**: Form submission doesn't trigger API call, causing test timeout
**Root Cause**: Unknown - possible async validation, timing issue, or checkbox state not properly set
**Impact**: Tests cannot complete registration flow

**Error Pattern**:
```
Test timeout of 30000ms exceeded.
Error: page.waitForResponse: Test timeout of 30000ms exceeded.
const apiResponsePromise = page.waitForResponse(...)
```

### Second Execution (After Fixes)
- **Total Tests**: 4 (vendor-registration-integration.spec.ts only)
- **Status**: All 4 tests failed
- **Duration**: ~60 seconds

**Failures**:
1. ✘ should complete full registration flow (30.1s timeout)
2. ✘ should show validation errors for invalid data (no error messages found)
3. ✘ should handle duplicate email error (30.1s timeout)
4. ✘ should disable submit button during submission (button not disabled)

## Architecture Observations

### Database & API Structure
- **CMS**: Payload CMS with SQLite database
- **Collections**: `users`, `vendors`
- **Status Flow**:
  - User registration → `users.status = 'pending'`
  - Admin approval → `users.status = 'active'`
  - Tier assignment → `vendors.tier = 'free'|'tier1'|'tier2'`

### Authentication Flow
- JWT-based authentication (access + refresh tokens)
- Login blocked for `pending` accounts (403 Forbidden)
- Vendor dashboard requires `approved` status

### Tier-Based Access Control
- **Free Tier**: Basic profile fields only
- **Tier 1**: Enhanced profile (website, social links, certifications)
- **Tier 2**: Product management + all tier 1 features

### UI Components
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **Checkbox**: Custom shadcn/ui component (uses `onCheckedChange` not standard checkbox events)
- **Toasts**: Sonner library for notifications

## Test Implementation Patterns

### Data Seeding
Tests create fresh test data via registration API:
```typescript
const testEmail = `vendor-${Date.now()}@example.com`;
const testCompany = `Test Company ${Date.now()}`;
```

### Verification Strategy
1. **API Response Verification**: Wait for API calls and validate response body
2. **URL Navigation**: Verify redirects using `page.waitForURL()`
3. **UI State**: Check element visibility and content
4. **Data Persistence**: Reload page and verify data retained

### Selector Strategy
- Placeholder text: `getByPlaceholder('vendor@example.com')`
- Labels: `getByLabel('Company Name')`
- Roles: `getByRole('button', { name: 'Login' })`
- Heading: `locator('h1')`

## Known Limitations

### Admin Approval Not Implemented
The tests assume an admin approval endpoint exists (`/api/admin/approve-vendor`), but this endpoint is not yet implemented. Tests document this limitation and skip steps that require approved vendors.

**Impact**:
- Cannot test post-approval workflows end-to-end
- Cannot verify dashboard access for approved vendors
- Cannot test tier upgrade scenarios

**Workaround**: Tests document the limitation and skip gracefully with clear log messages

### Tier Upgrade Mechanism Missing
Vendors are created as `free` tier by default. No API endpoint exists to upgrade tiers programmatically.

**Impact**:
- Cannot test tier1/tier2 specific features
- Cannot verify tier restriction enforcement for upgraded accounts

**Workaround**: Tests verify UI patterns and document the limitation

### Checkbox Interaction Flakiness
The custom Checkbox component may not respond reliably to Playwright's `.click()` action, causing form submission to fail.

**Potential Solutions**:
1. Use `page.evaluate()` to directly set form values
2. Add `data-testid` attributes to checkbox for more reliable targeting
3. Wait for checkbox state change after click
4. Use `force: true` option for click action

## Test Quality Assessment

### Strengths
✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests cover complete user workflows
✅ **Real Integration**: Uses actual database and API (no mocking)
✅ **Clear Documentation**: Each test includes descriptive comments
✅ **Error Handling**: Tests gracefully handle missing features
✅ **Evidence Collection**: Screenshots captured at key points

### Weaknesses
❌ **Failing Tests**: All tests currently fail due to form submission issue
❌ **Missing Features**: Admin approval and tier upgrades not implemented
❌ **Timing Issues**: Form submission timing not properly handled
❌ **Flaky Selectors**: Checkbox interaction unreliable

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Required for tests to pass)
1. **Debug Form Submission**: Investigate why form doesn't submit
   - Check for JavaScript errors in console
   - Verify all required fields are filled
   - Add explicit waits after checkbox click
   - Use Playwright debug mode to inspect form state

2. **Implement Admin Approval**: Create `/api/admin/approve-vendor` endpoint
   - Update `users.status` from 'pending' to 'active'
   - Include authentication checks (admin only)
   - Return updated vendor data

3. **Implement Tier Upgrade**: Create `/api/admin/upgrade-vendor-tier` endpoint
   - Update `vendors.tier` field
   - Validate tier value (free/tier1/tier2)
   - Trigger any tier-specific setup

### Future Enhancements
1. Add visual regression testing with Playwright screenshots
2. Create test fixtures for common test data
3. Implement database cleanup between tests
4. Add API integration tests separate from E2E tests
5. Create admin UI E2E tests for approval workflow

## Files Modified

### New Test Files
- `/home/edwin/development/ptnextjs/tests/e2e/admin-approval-flow.spec.ts`
- `/home/edwin/development/ptnextjs/tests/e2e/vendor-dashboard-flow.spec.ts`
- `/home/edwin/development/ptnextjs/tests/e2e/tier-restriction-flow.spec.ts`

### Updated Test Files
- `/home/edwin/development/ptnextjs/tests/e2e/vendor-registration-integration.spec.ts` (fixed URLs and checkbox)

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Form Submission**: Debug and resolve the form submission timeout issue
2. **Implement Missing APIs**: Create admin approval and tier upgrade endpoints
3. **Re-run Tests**: Execute full test suite after fixes
4. **Generate Report**: Create HTML report with `npx playwright show-report`
5. **Document Results**: Update this summary with final test results

## Conclusion

While the E2E test files have been successfully created with comprehensive coverage of the vendor enrollment workflows, the tests are currently unable to complete execution due to a form submission issue. The test architecture is sound and follows Playwright best practices, but requires:

1. Resolution of the form submission/checkbox interaction issue
2. Implementation of admin approval functionality
3. Implementation of tier upgrade functionality

Once these issues are resolved, the test suite will provide robust validation of the entire vendor enrollment system, from registration through profile management and tier-based access control.

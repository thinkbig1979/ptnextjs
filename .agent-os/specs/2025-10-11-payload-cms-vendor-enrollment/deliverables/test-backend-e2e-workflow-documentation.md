---

## Critical Backend Workflows

### Workflow 1: Complete Vendor Enrollment Flow ✅

**Description**: Tests the complete journey of a vendor from registration through admin approval to successful login.

**Steps**:
1. **Vendor Registration** → POST /api/vendors/register
   - User submits registration form
   - System validates input data
   - System creates User record (role: vendor, status: pending)
   - System creates Vendor record (tier: free, published: false)
   - System hashes password with bcrypt
   - System returns vendorId and pending status

2. **Admin Lists Pending Vendors** → GET /api/admin/vendors/pending
   - Admin authenticates with JWT
   - System verifies admin role
   - System returns list of pending vendors
   - List includes vendor details and registration timestamp

3. **Admin Approves Vendor** → POST /api/admin/vendors/[id]/approve
   - Admin sends approval request with vendor ID
   - System verifies admin JWT and role
   - System updates User status to "active"
   - System updates Vendor published to true
   - System sends approval notification (if configured)
   - System returns success confirmation

4. **Vendor Logs In** → POST /api/auth/login
   - Vendor submits email and password
   - System validates credentials
   - System verifies user status is "active"
   - System generates JWT tokens (access + refresh)
   - System sets httpOnly cookie with access token
   - System returns tokens and user data

5. **Vendor Accesses Protected Resources**
   - Vendor sends authenticated requests
   - Middleware validates JWT from header or cookie
   - Middleware attaches user data to request (x-user-* headers)
   - API routes enforce tier restrictions
   - Vendor can access free-tier features

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Integration tests for approval workflow (`__tests__/integration/api/admin/approval.test.ts`)
- ✅ Integration tests for login workflow (`__tests__/integration/api/auth/login.test.ts`)
- ⚠️ E2E tests for registration workflow (`__tests__/integration/api/vendors/register.test.ts` - requires running server)

**Expected Results**:
- All database operations complete successfully
- Transactions are atomic (rollback on failure)
- JWT tokens are valid and secure
- User status transitions correctly (pending → active)
- Vendor can log in after approval
- Vendor cannot log in while pending

---

### Workflow 2: Vendor Rejection Flow ✅

**Description**: Tests the admin's ability to reject vendor applications.

**Steps**:
1. **Vendor Registration** → POST /api/vendors/register
   - Vendor completes registration (same as Workflow 1, Step 1)
   - System creates pending vendor record

2. **Admin Reviews Application** → GET /api/admin/vendors/pending
   - Admin views pending vendor details
   - Admin decides to reject application

3. **Admin Rejects Vendor** → POST /api/admin/vendors/[id]/reject
   - Admin sends rejection request with reason
   - System verifies admin JWT and role
   - System updates User status to "rejected"
   - System stores rejection reason
   - System sends rejection notification (if configured)
   - System returns success confirmation

4. **Vendor Attempts Login** → POST /api/auth/login
   - Vendor submits credentials
   - System validates credentials
   - System checks user status (rejected)
   - System returns 403 Forbidden with rejection reason
   - Vendor cannot access platform

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Integration tests for rejection workflow (`__tests__/integration/api/admin/approval.test.ts`)
- ✅ Unit tests for status validation

**Expected Results**:
- Rejected vendors cannot log in
- Rejection reason is stored and retrievable
- Admin receives confirmation of rejection
- System prevents re-registration with same email

### Workflow 3: Vendor Profile Update with Tier Restrictions ✅

**Description**: Tests vendor's ability to update profile with tier-based field access control.

**Steps**:
1. **Free Tier Vendor Logs In** → POST /api/auth/login
   - Vendor logs in with credentials
   - System returns JWT with tier: "free"

2. **Free Tier Vendor Updates Basic Profile** → PATCH /api/vendors/[id]
   - Vendor updates allowed fields (companyName, description, etc.)
   - System validates JWT and ownership
   - System validates tier access to requested fields
   - System allows updates to free-tier fields
   - System updates Vendor record
   - System returns updated vendor data

3. **Free Tier Vendor Attempts Tier1 Field Update** → PATCH /api/vendors/[id]
   - Vendor attempts to update tier1-only fields (e.g., caseStudies)
   - System validates JWT and ownership
   - System checks tier permissions
   - System returns 403 Forbidden with upgrade message
   - Vendor record is NOT updated

4. **Tier2 Vendor Updates Advanced Profile** → PATCH /api/vendors/[id]
   - Tier2 vendor logs in
   - Vendor updates tier2 fields (partnerships, certifications, etc.)
   - System validates JWT and tier
   - System allows all field updates
   - System updates Vendor record
   - System returns updated vendor data

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Unit tests for tier validation (`__tests__/unit/utils/tier-validator.test.ts`)
- ✅ Unit tests for update validation (`__tests__/unit/validation/vendor-update.test.ts`)
- ⚠️ E2E tests for update API (`__tests__/integration/api/vendors/update.test.ts` - requires running server)

**Expected Results**:
- Free tier can only update free-tier fields
- Tier1 can update free and tier1 fields
- Tier2 can update all fields
- System returns clear upgrade messages when tier is insufficient
- Updates are atomic (all or nothing)

---

### Workflow 4: Tier Upgrade Flow ✅

**Description**: Tests the process of upgrading vendor tier and accessing new features.

**Steps**:
1. **Free Tier Vendor Requests Upgrade**
   - Vendor initiates tier upgrade request (manual process)
   - Admin reviews upgrade request

2. **Admin Approves Tier Upgrade** → PATCH /api/admin/vendors/[id]/tier
   - Admin updates vendor tier (free → tier1 or tier2)
   - System validates admin JWT and role
   - System updates Vendor.tier field
   - System updates User.tier field (for JWT generation)
   - System sends upgrade confirmation
   - System returns updated vendor data

3. **Vendor Logs In Again** → POST /api/auth/login
   - Vendor logs in after tier upgrade
   - System generates new JWT with updated tier
   - Vendor receives access token with new tier

4. **Vendor Accesses New Features** → PATCH /api/vendors/[id]
   - Vendor updates previously restricted fields
   - System validates JWT with new tier
   - System allows access to tier1/tier2 fields
   - System updates Vendor record
   - Vendor can now manage advanced features

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Unit tests for tier validation logic
- ✅ Integration tests for tier-based access control
- ⚠️ E2E tests for tier upgrade flow (requires admin panel)

**Expected Results**:
- Tier upgrades persist across sessions
- JWT tokens include updated tier information
- Vendor immediately gains access to new fields
- No data loss during tier upgrade
- Tier downgrades are prevented (business rule)

### Workflow 5: Data Consistency Across Operations ✅

**Description**: Tests that data remains consistent across multiple backend operations.

**Steps**:
1. **Vendor Registration** → POST /api/vendors/register
   - Creates User and Vendor records
   - Both records reference each other (user.id ↔ vendor.user)

2. **Multiple Concurrent Updates**
   - Vendor updates profile
   - Admin updates vendor status
   - System uses transactions to ensure atomicity

3. **Verification**
   - Query User record
   - Query Vendor record
   - Verify referential integrity
   - Verify all updates applied correctly

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Integration tests for PayloadCMSDataService (`__tests__/integration/lib/payload-cms-data-service.test.ts`)
- ✅ Migration tests verify data integrity (`__tests__/integration/migration/*.test.ts`)

**Expected Results**:
- No orphaned records (User without Vendor or vice versa)
- Referential integrity maintained
- Transactions rollback on failure
- Concurrent updates don't cause race conditions
- Data migrations preserve all relationships

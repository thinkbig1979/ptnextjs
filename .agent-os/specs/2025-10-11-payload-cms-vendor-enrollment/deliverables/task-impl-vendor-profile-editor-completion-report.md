## Acceptance Criteria Verification

All 10 acceptance criteria have been met:

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | VendorProfileEditor component created with all field groups | ✅ | Component contains Basic Info (5 fields), Enhanced Profile (4 fields), Products link |
| 2 | TierGate component wraps tier-restricted fields | ✅ | Enhanced Profile section wrapped in `<TierGate requiredTier="tier1">` |
| 3 | Free tier sees only basic fields | ✅ | Basic Information always visible, Enhanced Profile hidden by TierGate |
| 4 | Tier 1+ sees enhanced profile fields | ✅ | TierGate uses hasTierAccess() allowing tier1 and tier2 access |
| 5 | Tier 2 sees products link (not editable fields) | ✅ | Conditional rendering with button linking to `/vendor/dashboard/products` |
| 6 | Form pre-populates with current vendor data | ✅ | fetchProfile() and populateForm() implemented |
| 7 | Save button triggers API call | ✅ | onSubmit() makes PATCH request to `/api/vendors/${vendorId}` |
| 8 | Success: Toast notification + data refresh | ✅ | Success toast, local state update, and user context refresh |
| 9 | Error: Toast notification with error message | ✅ | Tier restriction, validation, and generic error handling with toasts |
| 10 | Loading state during save operation | ✅ | isSaving state controls button, shows "Saving..." with spinner |

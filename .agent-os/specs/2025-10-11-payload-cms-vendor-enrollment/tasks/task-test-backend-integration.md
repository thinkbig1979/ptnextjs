# Task: test-backend-integration - Execute Backend Integration Tests

## Task Metadata
- **Task ID**: test-backend-integration
- **Phase**: Phase 2: Backend Implementation
- **Agent**: test-architect
- **Estimated Time**: 25-30 minutes
- **Dependencies**: [impl-api-admin-approval, impl-api-vendor-update, impl-api-vendor-registration, impl-api-auth-login, impl-payload-data-service, impl-migration-scripts]
- **Status**: [ ] Not Started

## Task Description
Execute comprehensive backend integration tests covering all API endpoints, database operations, authentication flows, and migration scripts. Verify 80%+ test coverage and all acceptance criteria met.

## Specifics
- **Test Execution**:
  - Run all backend unit tests: `npm test -- __tests__/lib/services`
  - Run all API integration tests: `npm test -- __tests__/api`
  - Run migration script tests: `npm test -- __tests__/scripts/migration`
  - Generate coverage report: `npm test -- --coverage`
- **Critical Test Scenarios**:
  - Vendor registration → approval → login flow
  - Tier restriction enforcement (free tier cannot access tier1 fields)
  - Admin-only endpoint access control
  - Migration script data transformation accuracy
  - JWT token generation and validation
  - Password hashing and comparison

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All backend unit tests pass (100%)
- [ ] All API integration tests pass (100%)
- [ ] Migration script tests pass (100%)
- [ ] Test coverage ≥80% for services and API routes
- [ ] No console errors or warnings during test execution
- [ ] Test results documented with evidence

## Evidence Required
- Test coverage report showing ≥80% coverage
- Test execution logs with all tests passing
- Evidence of critical scenarios passing (screenshots/logs)

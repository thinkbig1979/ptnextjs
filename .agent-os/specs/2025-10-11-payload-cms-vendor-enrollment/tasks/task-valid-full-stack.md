# Task: valid-full-stack - Validate Full-Stack Completeness and Quality

## Task Metadata
- **Task ID**: valid-full-stack
- **Phase**: Phase 4: Frontend-Backend Integration
- **Agent**: quality-assurance
- **Estimated Time**: 30-35 minutes
- **Dependencies**: [test-e2e-workflow]
- **Status**: [ ] Not Started

## Task Description
Perform comprehensive quality validation of the complete full-stack implementation covering functionality, performance, security, accessibility, and code quality.

## Specifics
- **Validation Areas**:
  - **Functionality**: All user stories and acceptance criteria met
  - **Performance**: API response times, page load times, database query performance
  - **Security**: Authentication, authorization, input validation, XSS/CSRF protection
  - **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
  - **Code Quality**: TypeScript types, test coverage, linting, formatting
  - **Database**: Schema correctness, indexes, constraints, data integrity
  - **Integration**: Frontend-backend data flow, error handling, edge cases
- **Validation Checklist**:
  - [ ] All spec requirements implemented
  - [ ] All user stories testable and verified
  - [ ] Backend test coverage ≥80%
  - [ ] Frontend test coverage ≥80%
  - [ ] E2E tests cover critical workflows
  - [ ] API response times < 500ms (95th percentile)
  - [ ] Page load times < 2s (First Contentful Paint)
  - [ ] Password hashing uses bcrypt with 12 rounds
  - [ ] JWT tokens use secure algorithms
  - [ ] Tier restrictions enforced at UI and API levels
  - [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verified with axe-core
  - [ ] All forms keyboard accessible
  - [ ] TypeScript strict mode enabled and passing
  - [ ] ESLint rules passing
  - [ ] Database schema matches technical spec

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Functionality validation: All features working as specified
- [ ] Performance validation: Response times and load times meet targets
- [ ] Security validation: No critical vulnerabilities, auth/authz working
- [ ] Accessibility validation: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verified
- [ ] Code quality validation: Test coverage, linting, types all passing
- [ ] Database validation: Schema correct, indexes in place, constraints enforced
- [ ] Integration validation: Frontend-backend flows working correctly
- [ ] Validation report created documenting all findings
- [ ] Any issues identified have tickets created and prioritized

## Evidence Required
- Validation report with all checklist items marked
- Test coverage reports (backend and frontend)
- Performance metrics (API response times, page load times)
- Security audit results (auth/authz checks)
- Accessibility audit results (axe-core report)
- Code quality metrics (TypeScript, ESLint)

## Context Requirements
- All completed implementation tasks
- Technical spec acceptance criteria
- Quality standards from @.agent-os/standards/
- Testing tools: Jest coverage, Lighthouse, axe-core

## Implementation Notes
- Use automated tools where possible (Lighthouse, axe-core, ESLint)
- Manual verification for complex workflows
- Document any deviations from spec with justification
- Create tickets for any issues found but not blocking
- Prioritize security and data integrity issues

## Quality Gates
- [ ] All critical acceptance criteria met
- [ ] No blocking security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Test coverage meets targets
- [ ] Performance meets targets
- [ ] Accessibility compliance verified

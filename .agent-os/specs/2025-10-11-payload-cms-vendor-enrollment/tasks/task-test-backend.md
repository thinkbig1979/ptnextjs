# Task: test-backend - Design Comprehensive Backend Test Suite

## Task Metadata
- **Task ID**: test-backend
- **Phase**: Phase 2: Backend Implementation
- **Agent**: test-architect
- **Estimated Time**: 20-25 minutes
- **Dependencies**: [pre-2]
- **Status**: [ ] Not Started

## Task Description
Design comprehensive test suite for backend implementation including Payload CMS collections, API endpoints, authentication, authorization, tier restrictions, and migration scripts. Define test strategies for unit, integration, and database tests.

## Specifics
- **Test Coverage Areas**:
  - Payload CMS collection schemas and hooks
  - API endpoint request/response validation
  - Authentication and JWT token management
  - Authorization and tier restriction enforcement
  - Migration script data transformation accuracy
  - Database constraints and relationships
- **Test Files to Create**:
  - `/home/edwin/development/ptnextjs/__tests__/payload/collections/*.test.ts` - Collection schema tests
  - `/home/edwin/development/ptnextjs/__tests__/api/vendors/*.test.ts` - Vendor API endpoint tests
  - `/home/edwin/development/ptnextjs/__tests__/api/auth/*.test.ts` - Authentication tests
  - `/home/edwin/development/ptnextjs/__tests__/lib/services/*.test.ts` - Service layer tests
  - `/home/edwin/development/ptnextjs/__tests__/scripts/migration/*.test.ts` - Migration script tests
- **Test Strategies**:
  - Unit tests with Jest for business logic
  - Integration tests with Supertest for API routes
  - Database tests with test fixtures and rollback
  - Mock Payload CMS local API for isolated testing
  - E2E API tests with real database instances

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test plan document created with coverage map
- [ ] Test file structure defined for all backend components
- [ ] Mock strategies defined for Payload CMS and database
- [ ] Test fixtures planned for users, vendors, products
- [ ] Integration test approach documented for API endpoints
- [ ] Database test approach with setup/teardown defined
- [ ] Migration test strategy with validation checks planned
- [ ] Target coverage: 80%+ for services and critical paths

## Testing Requirements
- **Unit Test Requirements**:
  - VendorService: createVendor, updateVendor, validateTierAccess
  - AuthService: login, validateToken, hashPassword
  - ApprovalService: approveVendor, rejectVendor
  - MigrationService: data transformation functions
- **Integration Test Requirements**:
  - POST /api/vendors/register - validation, duplicate detection
  - POST /api/auth/login - success/failure scenarios
  - PUT /api/vendors/{id} - tier restriction enforcement
  - Admin approval endpoints - RBAC validation
- **Database Test Requirements**:
  - Foreign key constraint validation
  - Unique constraint enforcement
  - Cascading delete behavior
  - Index performance verification

## Context Requirements
- Technical Spec: Database schema and API endpoint definitions
- Understanding of Payload CMS testing patterns
- Knowledge of Jest, Supertest, and database testing tools
- Backend implementation requirements from technical spec

## Implementation Notes
- Use Jest with TypeScript for all backend tests
- Set up test database with migrations for integration tests
- Create reusable test fixtures for common entities
- Implement test utilities for JWT token generation
- Consider using Testcontainers for PostgreSQL tests if needed

## Quality Gates
- [ ] All critical backend paths have test coverage planned
- [ ] Test data fixtures include all edge cases
- [ ] Mock strategies isolate units effectively
- [ ] Integration tests validate full request/response cycles

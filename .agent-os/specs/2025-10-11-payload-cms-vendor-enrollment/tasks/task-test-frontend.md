# Task: test-frontend - Design Comprehensive Frontend Test Suite

## Task Metadata
- **Task ID**: test-frontend
- **Phase**: Phase 3: Frontend Implementation
- **Agent**: test-architect
- **Estimated Time**: 20-25 minutes
- **Dependencies**: [test-backend-integration]
- **Status**: [ ] Not Started

## Task Description
Design comprehensive test suite for frontend implementation including React components, forms, state management, routing, and user workflows. Define test strategies for unit, integration, and E2E tests.

## Specifics
- **Test Coverage Areas**:
  - VendorRegistrationForm component with validation
  - VendorLoginForm component with authentication
  - VendorDashboard component with routing
  - VendorProfileEditor component with tier restrictions
  - AdminApprovalQueue component with approval actions
  - TierGate component with tier-based rendering
  - AuthContext with login/logout state management
  - User flow integration (registration → approval → login → edit)
- **Test Files Structure**:
  - `__tests__/components/vendor/*.test.tsx` - Vendor component tests
  - `__tests__/components/admin/*.test.tsx` - Admin component tests
  - `__tests__/components/shared/*.test.tsx` - Shared component tests
  - `__tests__/context/AuthContext.test.tsx` - Auth context tests
  - `__tests__/e2e/vendor-workflow.spec.ts` - E2E user workflow tests (Playwright)
- **Test Strategies**:
  - Unit tests with Jest + React Testing Library for components
  - MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking
  - E2E tests with Playwright for critical user flows
  - Coverage target: 80%+ for components and context

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test plan document created with coverage map
- [ ] Test file structure defined for all frontend components
- [ ] Mock strategies defined for API calls (MSW)
- [ ] Component test approach documented (React Testing Library)
- [ ] E2E test approach documented (Playwright)
- [ ] User workflow scenarios defined for E2E testing
- [ ] Target coverage: 80%+ for components and critical paths

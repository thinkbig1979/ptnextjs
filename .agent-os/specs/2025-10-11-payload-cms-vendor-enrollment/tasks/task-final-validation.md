- **Agent**: quality-assurance
- **Estimated Time**: 20-25 minutes
- **Dependencies**: [final-migration]
- **Status**: [ ] Not Started

## Task Description
Perform final end-to-end system validation covering all features, migrated content, and production readiness. Prepare handoff documentation and deployment checklist.

## Specifics
- **Final Validation Areas**:
  - **User Workflows**: Test complete vendor registration → approval → login → profile edit workflow
  - **Migrated Content**: Verify public pages display all migrated content correctly
  - **Admin Workflows**: Test admin approval queue, vendor management
  - **Authentication**: Test login/logout, token refresh, session management
  - **Tier Restrictions**: Verify tier-based access control working in production
  - **Performance**: Check API response times and page load times
  - **Security**: Verify HTTPS, httpOnly cookies, CSRF protection enabled
  - **Database**: Verify PostgreSQL connection, indexes, constraints
- **Production Readiness Checklist**:
  - [ ] All environment variables configured for production
  - [ ] DATABASE_URL points to production PostgreSQL
  - [ ] JWT_SECRET is strong and secure

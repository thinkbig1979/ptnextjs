# Task: pre-2 - Create Integration Strategy and Architecture Plan

## Task Metadata
- **Task ID**: pre-2
- **Phase**: Phase 1: Pre-Execution Analysis
- **Agent**: integration-coordinator
- **Estimated Time**: 5-8 minutes
- **Dependencies**: [pre-1]
- **Status**: [ ] Not Started

## Task Description
Create a comprehensive integration strategy for Payload CMS installation and migration from TinaCMS, defining architecture patterns, integration points, and migration approach based on codebase analysis findings.

## Specifics
- **Integration Strategy Components**:
  - Payload CMS installation plan (SQLite dev, PostgreSQL prod)
  - TinaCMS → Payload CMS migration strategy
  - Authentication integration approach
  - Data service replacement strategy (TinaCMSDataService → PayloadCMSDataService)
  - API route architecture for vendor endpoints
  - Frontend-backend integration patterns
- **Architecture Decisions**:
  - Collection schema design aligning with existing types
  - Access control and RBAC implementation approach
  - Migration script execution order
  - Error handling and rollback strategy
- **Output Requirements**:
  - Integration architecture document
  - Migration sequence plan
  - Risk mitigation strategies
  - Rollback procedures

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Payload CMS installation plan documented with package versions
- [ ] Migration strategy defined with execution sequence
- [ ] Integration points mapped to existing codebase
- [ ] Risk assessment completed with mitigation plans
- [ ] Architecture aligns with Next.js App Router patterns
- [ ] Rollback procedures documented for safe migration

## Context Requirements
- Findings from task pre-1 (codebase analysis)
- Understanding of Payload CMS 3.x architecture
- Knowledge of database portability (SQLite → PostgreSQL)
- Understanding of Next.js App Router API routes

## Implementation Notes
- Prioritize minimal disruption to existing functionality
- Ensure backward compatibility during migration
- Plan for incremental migration if full cutover is risky
- Consider content validation at each migration stage

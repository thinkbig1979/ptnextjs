**ID**: valid-full-stack
**Title**: Validate full-stack implementation completeness and quality
**Agent**: quality-assurance
**Estimated Time**: 2 hours
**Dependencies**: test-e2e-computed-fields
**Phase**: 4 - Frontend-Backend Integration

## Context Requirements

Read these files:
- @.agent-os/specs/2025-10-24-tier-structure-implementation/spec.md - Full specification
- @.agent-os/specs/2025-10-24-tier-structure-implementation/sub-specs/technical-spec.md - Technical requirements
- All implemented code files

## Objectives

1. Verify all 40+ fields implemented in schema
2. Verify all API endpoints implemented and working
3. Verify all UI components implemented
4. Check test coverage meets 80% minimum
5. Verify tier validation works across full stack
6. Verify computed fields accurate in all contexts
7. Check accessibility compliance
8. Verify responsive design works
9. Check performance meets requirements
10. Verify security requirements met

**ID**: pre-1
**Title**: Perform codebase analysis for tier structure integration
**Agent**: context-fetcher
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes
**Dependencies**: None
**Phase**: 1 - Pre-Execution Analysis

## Context Requirements

Read these files to understand the full scope:
- @.agent-os/specs/2025-10-24-tier-structure-implementation/spec.md
- @.agent-os/specs/2025-10-24-tier-structure-implementation/sub-specs/technical-spec.md

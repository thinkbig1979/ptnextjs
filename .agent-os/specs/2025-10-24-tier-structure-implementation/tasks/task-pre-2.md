# Task PRE-2: Create Integration Strategy

**ID**: pre-2
**Title**: Create integration strategy for tier structure implementation
**Agent**: integration-coordinator
**Estimated Time**: 45 minutes
**Dependencies**: pre-1
**Phase**: 1 - Pre-Execution Analysis

## Context Requirements

Read these files:
- @.agent-os/specs/2025-10-24-tier-structure-implementation/tasks/task-pre-1.md - Codebase analysis results
- @.agent-os/specs/2025-10-24-tier-structure-implementation/sub-specs/technical-spec.md - Technical specification
- Analysis document from PRE-1

## Objectives

1. Design phased implementation approach (backend → frontend → integration)
2. Identify critical path tasks and parallel execution opportunities
3. Plan database migration strategy without data loss
4. Design API versioning strategy if needed
5. Plan component integration with existing dashboard
6. Identify rollback strategies for each phase

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Phased implementation plan with 4 distinct phases
- [ ] Dependency graph showing task relationships
- [ ] Migration strategy that preserves existing vendor data
- [ ] Component integration plan for LocationsManagerCard reuse
- [ ] Risk assessment for each phase with mitigation strategies
- [ ] Rollback procedures documented for critical changes
- [ ] Testing strategy for each integration point

## Testing Requirements

- Validate that all dependencies are correctly sequenced
- Ensure no circular dependencies in task graph
- Verify migration strategy is reversible

## Evidence Requirements

- Integration strategy document (markdown)
- Task dependency graph (mermaid diagram)
- Migration rollback procedures
- Component integration diagram
- Risk assessment matrix

# Enhanced Vendor Product Form - Summary

Expand the vendor dashboard product form from 3 fields (name, description, shortDescription) to 25+ fields, enabling Tier 2 vendors to create comprehensive product showcases with images, pricing, specifications, features, categories, action buttons, badges, and SEO metadata. The API and backend already support these fields - this is a UI-only enhancement using existing shadcn/ui components and React Hook Form.

## Key Deliverables
1. Tabbed/accordion form with progressive disclosure
2. Image management (URL-based with main image designation)
3. Pricing configuration with contact form toggle
4. Specifications as label/value pairs
5. Features with icons and descriptions
6. Category and tag multi-select
7. Action button and badge configuration
8. SEO metadata fields

## Scope Exclusions
- File upload (URL-only for images)
- Interactive content (360°, 3D, video, AR)
- Owner reviews, comparison metrics, integration matrix

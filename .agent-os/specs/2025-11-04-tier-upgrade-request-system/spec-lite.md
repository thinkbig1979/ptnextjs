# Tier Upgrade Request System - Lite Summary

Replace the current manual mailto-based tier upgrade process with an automated in-platform workflow where vendors submit tier change requests through a dedicated subscription page, admins review and approve/reject requests in a queue, and tier updates happen automatically upon approval.

## Key Points
- **Problem**: Vendors currently click "Upgrade" buttons that open mailto links, creating a manual offline process with no tracking or automation
- **Solution**: Build vendor request submission UI, admin approval queue in Payload CMS, and automated tier update API with full audit trail
- **Impact**: Eliminates operational overhead, provides real-time status tracking for vendors, and maintains admin control while automating tier changes in seconds instead of hours/days

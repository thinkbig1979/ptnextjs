## Task File Structure

Each task file follows the proven pattern from Phase 2 and includes:

### 1. Task Metadata
- **Task ID**: Unique identifier
- **Phase**: Which phase this belongs to
- **Agent**: Recommended AI agent or specialist role
- **Estimated Time**: How long to complete (30-75 minutes per task)
- **Dependencies**: Which tasks must be completed first
- **Status**: Checkbox for tracking completion

### 2. Task Description
- Clear explanation of what needs to be built
- Context on why this component exists

### 3. Specifics
- **Exact file paths** to create (e.g., `/home/edwin/development/ptnextjs/lib/services/tier-request-service.ts`)
- **Code snippets** showing implementation patterns
- **Database schemas** with SQL/TypeScript
- **API contracts** with request/response examples

### 4. Acceptance Criteria
- **10-15 checkboxes** of specific requirements
- Concrete, verifiable conditions for "done"
- Examples:
  - ✅ Migration runs successfully without errors
  - ✅ All CHECK constraints enforce enum values
  - ✅ UUID generation produces valid v4 UUIDs

### 5. Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Specific test cases to write
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end scenarios
- **Manual Verification**: Steps to validate in browser/database
- Code examples showing how to test

### 6. Evidence Required
- Screenshots, test results, database queries
- Proof that task is actually complete
- Examples:
  - "Screenshot of Payload admin showing new geographic fields"
  - "Test results showing 100% pass rate"

### 7. Implementation Notes
- **SQLite-specific guidance** (JSON serialization, UUID generation, etc.)
- **Code patterns** with working examples
- **Gotchas** and common mistakes to avoid
- **Performance tips** for optimization

### 8. Quality Gates
- Non-negotiable standards
- Examples:
  - ✅ No TypeScript errors after installation
  - ✅ All timestamps in ISO 8601 format
  - ✅ Accessibility score >90 on Lighthouse

### 9. Related Files
- Links to specs, dependencies, technical docs
- Context for understanding the bigger picture

### 10. Next Steps After Completion
- What to do once this task is done
- Dependencies this task unblocks

## How to Use These Task Files

### For Implementation
1. **Start with task #1**: `task-db-vendor-geographic-fields.md`
2. **Read the entire file** before coding
3. **Follow acceptance criteria** as a checklist
4. **Run all tests** before marking complete
5. **Provide evidence** (screenshots, test results)
6. **Update README.md** to mark task as complete

### For Project Management
- **Estimate timeline**: Each task is 30-75 minutes
- **Track progress**: 11/33 completed = 33% done
- **Identify blockers**: Check dependencies in each task
- **Assign work**: Agent field suggests specialist role

### For Quality Assurance
- **Acceptance criteria** provide test plan
- **Evidence required** ensures thorough validation
- **Quality gates** enforce non-negotiable standards

## Comparison: Before vs. After

### ❌ Before (Incorrect Approach)
I initially created:
- `tasks.md` - High-level overview document
- `tasks-sqlite.md` - SQLite implementation guide (93KB)
- `tasks-postgres.md` - PostgreSQL migration guide (54KB)

**Problem**: These were comprehensive **guides**, not micro-granular task files. They provided strategy and patterns but lacked:
- Specific file paths to create
- Step-by-step acceptance criteria
- Concrete testing requirements
- Evidence requirements

### ✅ After (Correct Approach)
Now created:
- **11 detailed task files** (2-4KB each)
- **README.md** index file listing all 33 tasks
- Each task file is **actionable** and **self-contained**

**Solution**: Following the Phase 2 pattern (e.g., `task-impl-payload-install.md`), each file now provides:
- ✅ Exact file paths
- ✅ Code snippets
- ✅ Checklist acceptance criteria
- ✅ Specific testing steps
- ✅ Evidence requirements

## Key Features of These Task Files

### 1. SQLite-Specific Implementation
All task files use **SQLite-compatible** patterns:
- JSON serialization instead of native arrays/JSONB
- Application-layer UUID generation
- Boolean as INTEGER (0/1)
- Manual timestamp updates
- Application-layer unique constraint enforcement

### 2. Code Examples Throughout
Every task includes **working code snippets**:
- Database migrations with SQL
- Service methods with TypeScript
- Component implementations with React
- Test cases with Playwright

### 3. Comprehensive Testing
Each task specifies:
- **Unit tests** with example assertions
- **Integration tests** with database verification
- **Manual testing** steps for UI validation
- **Evidence required** (screenshots, test results)

### 4. Clear Dependencies
Each task lists:
- **Dependencies**: What must be completed first
- **Related Files**: Context and references
- **Next Steps**: What this task unblocks

### 5. Time Estimates
Realistic time estimates based on task complexity:
- Simple schema changes: 25-30 minutes
- Service implementations: 45-65 minutes
- Complex UI components: 60-75 minutes
- E2E testing: 60-75 minutes

## Next Steps

### To Continue Task Creation
If you want all 33 task files created, I can continue generating the remaining 22 files following this same pattern.

### To Start Implementation
You can begin implementing Phase 3A now using the 11 existing task files:
1. Start with `task-db-vendor-geographic-fields.md`
2. Work through tasks in dependency order (see README.md)
3. Check off acceptance criteria as you go
4. Provide evidence before moving to next task

### To Review Task Quality
You can review any of the 11 created task files to ensure they meet your standards and match the Phase 2 pattern you showed me.

# Spec Summary (Lite)

Add interactive OpenFreeMap maps to vendor detail pages using Leaflet.js and implement location-based search allowing users to find vendors near a specified location within a given radius (10, 25, 50, 100 miles). Use geocode.maps.co for address geocoding, store location data in Payload CMS SQLite database, and use Haversine formula for distance calculations and filtering.

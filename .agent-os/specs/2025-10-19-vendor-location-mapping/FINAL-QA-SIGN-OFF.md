## Console Error Analysis

**Finding**: 1 console error detected (401 Unauthorized)

**Analysis**: The error originates from a 3rd party API resource attempting to load an endpoint that requires authentication. This is unrelated to the vendor location mapping feature.

**Impact**: No impact on feature functionality

**Verdict**: Not a blocker for production deployment

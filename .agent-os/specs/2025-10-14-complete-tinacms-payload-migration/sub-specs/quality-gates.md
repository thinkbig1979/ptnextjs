# Quality Gates

This is the quality gates specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-10-14-complete-tinacms-payload-migration/spec.md

## Overview

Quality gates ensure the TinaCMS to Payload CMS migration meets production-ready standards before deployment. Gates are enforced at key milestones with measurable criteria and automated validation.

## Quality Metrics & Thresholds

### Code Quality Metrics

**Test Coverage**:
- **Minimum**: 80% overall coverage
- **Target**: 90%+ for critical paths (PayloadCMSDataService, migration scripts)
- **Measurement**: Jest coverage reports
- **Gate**: Build fails if coverage < 80%

**Type Safety**:
- **Requirement**: Zero TypeScript errors
- **Measurement**: `npm run type-check` must pass
- **Strict Mode**: Enabled in tsconfig.json
- **Gate**: Cannot merge PR with type errors

**Code Linting**:
- **Requirement**: Zero ESLint errors
- **Warnings**: < 5 warnings acceptable
- **Measurement**: `npm run lint` must pass
- **Auto-fix**: Run `npm run lint:fix` before commit
- **Gate**: Pre-commit hook blocks commits with errors

### Performance Metrics

**Build Time**:
- **Maximum**: 5 minutes for full static site generation
- **Measurement**: `npm run build` execution time
- **Baseline**: Current TinaCMS build time
- **Gate**: Build time regression > 20% requires optimization

**Page Load Performance**:
- **Homepage**: < 1 second (LCP)
- **Vendor Detail**: < 1.5 seconds (LCP)
- **Product Detail**: < 1.5 seconds (LCP)
- **Yacht Detail**: < 2 seconds (LCP)
- **Measurement**: Lighthouse CI, Chrome DevTools
- **Gate**: Performance score < 90 requires investigation

**API Response Time**:
- **Cached Requests**: < 100ms average
- **Uncached Requests**: < 500ms average
- **Complex Queries**: < 1 second (e.g., vendor with full relationships)
- **Measurement**: Performance.now() timing, API monitoring
- **Gate**: Response time regression > 30% blocks deployment

**Database Query Performance**:
- **Simple Queries**: < 50ms
- **Complex Queries**: < 200ms
- **Migration Scripts**: < 3 minutes total
- **Measurement**: PostgreSQL query logs, Payload telemetry
- **Gate**: Slow queries (> 1s) require optimization

### Data Quality Metrics

**Migration Completeness**:
- **Requirement**: 100% of TinaCMS content migrated
- **Measurement**: Record count comparison (markdown files vs database records)
- **Validation**:
  - Vendors: Count `.md` files in `content/vendors/` = Payload `vendors` count
  - Products: Count `.md` files in `content/products/` = Payload `products` count
  - Yachts: Count `.md` files in `content/yachts/` = Payload `yachts` count
  - Blog Posts, Team Members, Categories, Tags: Same pattern
- **Gate**: < 100% migration blocks production deployment

**Data Integrity**:
- **Requirement**: Zero orphaned records (e.g., products without vendors)
- **Relationship Validation**: All foreign keys resolve correctly
- **JSONB Validation**: All complex fields parse and validate
- **Media Paths**: 100% of media paths valid and accessible
- **Measurement**: Automated validation scripts
- **Gate**: Any data integrity issues block deployment

**Data Accuracy**:
- **Spot Check**: Manual verification of 20% of migrated content
- **Critical Fields**: 100% accuracy for companyName, slug, descriptions
- **Enhanced Fields**: Verify certifications, awards, case studies preserved correctly
- **Measurement**: Manual QA checklist
- **Gate**: > 5% data accuracy issues require re-migration

### Security Metrics

**Authentication & Authorization**:
- **Requirement**: Admin-only access to write operations
- **Vendor Dashboard**: Vendors can only edit own profiles
- **Public API**: Read-only access to published content
- **Measurement**: Security testing, role-based access tests
- **Gate**: Any auth bypass vulnerability blocks deployment

**Data Protection**:
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with salt rounds â‰¥ 10
- **JWT Security**: httpOnly cookies, secure transmission
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs sanitized
- **SQL Injection**: Zero vulnerabilities (parameterized queries)
- **Measurement**: Security audit, automated vulnerability scanning
- **Gate**: Any critical security issue blocks deployment

**Dependency Security**:
- **Requirement**: Zero critical or high vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Measurement**: `npm audit` must show 0 critical/high issues
- **Update Policy**: Dependencies updated within 30 days of security releases
- **Gate**: Critical vulnerabilities block deployment

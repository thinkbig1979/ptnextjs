## Risk Assessment

### Risks Mitigated by Planning
✓ **Scope Ambiguity** - Comprehensive deliverable manifest defines exact expectations
✓ **Missing Context** - Complete context package provided with codebase analysis
✓ **Verification Gaps** - Detailed verification criteria and procedures documented
✓ **Design Conflicts** - Sequential execution ensures PRE-2 uses PRE-1 outputs
✓ **Incomplete Deliverables** - Mandatory verification before task completion

### Remaining Risks (Phase 2+)
⚠ **Implementation Complexity** - Phase 2 backend implementation is complex (8 tasks)
⚠ **Migration Execution** - Data migration carries inherent risk (mitigated by rollback plan)
⚠ **Integration Issues** - Frontend-backend integration requires careful coordination

**Mitigation:** Phase 1 outputs provide detailed specifications to reduce Phase 2-5 risks.

---

## Timeline

### Phase 1 Execution Estimate
- **PRE-1:** 3 hours (integration strategy design)
- **PRE-2:** 2 hours (validation and rollback planning)
- **Verification:** 1 hour (deliverable verification)
- **Total:** 6 hours

### Critical Path
PRE-1 (3h) → PRE-1 Verification (0.5h) → PRE-2 (2h) → PRE-2 Verification (0.5h) → Phase 1 Complete

### Parallel Opportunities
None in Phase 1 - tasks are sequential due to PRE-2 dependency on PRE-1.

---

## Phase 2 Readiness

Once Phase 1 is complete, Phase 2 can proceed with:
- **Backend Implementation** (8 tasks)
  - Test suite design
  - Tags collection creation
  - Yachts collection creation
  - Vendor enhancement
  - Product enhancement
  - Transformation layer implementation
  - Markdown-to-Lexical converter
  - Backend integration testing

**Dependencies Satisfied by Phase 1:**
- Transformation layer architecture defined
- Field mappings for all collections
- Integration points identified
- Validation strategy established
- Rollback plan ready

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Now)
1. ✓ Orchestration preparation complete
2. → Delegate PRE-1 and PRE-2 to integration-coordinator
3. → Provide deliverable manifest and orchestration plan
4. → Monitor execution and track deliverables

### After PRE-1 Complete
1. Verify PRE-1 deliverables (3 files)
2. Confirm PRE-2 can proceed
3. Continue monitoring PRE-2 execution

### After PRE-2 Complete

3. Update task status (PRE-1 → Complete, PRE-2 → Complete)
4. Prepare Phase 2 orchestration

### Phase 1 Completion
1. Create Phase 1 completion report
2. Archive orchestration documents
3. Brief Phase 2 agents on design decisions
4. Proceed to Phase 2 Backend Implementation

### Deployment Documentation

Create comprehensive deployment guide:

#### Environment Variables
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
PAYLOAD_SECRET=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=...
```

#### Database Setup
1. Create production database
2. Run Payload migrations
3. Verify collections created
4. Verify admin user exists

#### Deployment Steps
1. Build application: `npm run build`
2. Deploy static assets
3. Deploy API server
4. Run database migrations
5. Verify deployment
6. Monitor for errors

#### Rollback Procedure
1. Stop new deployment
2. Restore previous deployment
3. Restore database backup
4. Verify rollback successful
5. Investigate issues

### Post-Deployment Validation

After deployment:
- [ ] Homepage loads
- [ ] All routes accessible
- [ ] Data displays correctly
- [ ] Images load
- [ ] Payload admin accessible
- [ ] No errors in logs
- [ ] Performance acceptable

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All quality checks passed
- [ ] Configuration validated
- [ ] Security validated
- [ ] Performance validated
- [ ] Deployment documentation complete
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] TinaCMS dependencies removed
- [ ] Application production-ready
- [ ] Stakeholder sign-off obtained

## Testing Requirements

### Pre-Deployment Testing
- Run all quality checks
- Verify configuration
- Test security measures
- Validate performance

### Deployment Dry-Run
- Test deployment procedure on staging
- Verify rollback procedure works
- Test post-deployment validation

## Evidence Required

**Documentation:**
1. Deployment guide (comprehensive)
2. Environment setup guide
3. Rollback procedure
4. Configuration checklist

**Validation Reports:**
1. Final quality report (all checks passed)
2. Security validation report
3. Performance validation report
4. Configuration validation report

**Sign-Off:**
- [ ] Technical lead approval
- [ ] Quality assurance approval
- [ ] Product owner approval
- [ ] Ready for production deployment

## Context Requirements

**Related Tasks:**
- All previous tasks (complete migration)
- final-build-validation (build must pass)

## Quality Gates

- [ ] 100% quality checks passed
- [ ] All documentation complete
- [ ] Security validated
- [ ] Performance validated
- [ ] Deployment tested on staging
- [ ] Rollback procedure tested
- [ ] Stakeholder approval obtained

## Notes

- This is the final gate before production deployment
- All issues must be resolved before proceeding
- Deployment documentation is critical for operations team
- Rollback plan ensures safe deployment
- TinaCMS removal finalizes migration
- Keep TinaCMS backup for 30 days (safety)
- Monitor deployment closely for first 24 hours
- Be ready to rollback if issues occur

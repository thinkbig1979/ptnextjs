## Testing Requirements

### Automated Validation
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test                    # Unit tests
npm run test:integration        # Integration tests
npm run test:e2e               # E2E tests

# Run build
npm run build                   # Static build
npm run type-check             # TypeScript
npm run lint                   # Linting
```

### Manual Validation
- Review all validation checklist items
- Spot-check 10% of each collection in Payload admin
- Compare side-by-side with TinaCMS content
- Verify enhanced fields populated correctly
- Test all pages in browser

### Performance Testing
- Measure build time
- Test page load times
- Verify caching reduces API calls
- Check memory usage

## Evidence Required

**Validation Reports:**
1. Data completeness report (entity counts)
2. Field parity report (field-by-field comparison)
3. Feature parity report (functionality checklist)
4. Enhanced features report (new features validated)
5. Performance report (build time, load times)
6. Code quality report (test results, coverage)

**Sign-Off Checklist:**
- [ ] Data completeness: 100%
- [ ] Field parity: 100%
- [ ] Feature parity: 100%
- [ ] Enhanced features: 100% functional
- [ ] Performance: All metrics met
- [ ] Code quality: All checks passed
- [ ] E2E tests: 100% passing
- [ ] Ready for production: YES/NO

## Context Requirements

**Technical Spec Sections:**
- Lines 964-1007: Success Metrics and Validation
- Success criteria: 0% data loss, 100% field parity, <5 min build

**Related Tasks:**
- All previous tasks (complete migration stack)

## Quality Gates

- [ ] Zero data loss (entity counts match exactly)
- [ ] 100% field parity (all TinaCMS fields mapped)
- [ ] All enhanced fields functional
- [ ] Build time < 5 minutes
- [ ] All tests passing (100%)
- [ ] No errors (TypeScript, lint, console)
- [ ] Application fully functional
- [ ] Ready for deployment

## Notes

- This is the final validation before production deployment
- Any failures must be resolved before proceeding
- Document all findings in validation reports
- Get stakeholder sign-off on validation results
- Keep validation reports for audit trail
- This task gates the final deployment tasks

# Task IMPL-FRONTEND-ENHANCED-TRANSFORMS: Update Transform Methods for Enhanced Fields

## Task Metadata
- **Task ID**: impl-frontend-enhanced-transforms
- **Phase**: Phase 3 - Frontend Implementation
- **Agent Assignment**: implementation-specialist
- **Estimated Time**: 4 hours
- **Dependencies**: impl-frontend-yacht-methods, impl-backend-vendor-enhance, impl-backend-product-enhance
- **Status**: Ready for Implementation
- **Priority**: High

## Task Description

Update transformVendor() and transformProduct() methods in PayloadCMSDataService to handle all enhanced fields including certifications, awards, social proof, case studies, comparison metrics, owner reviews, and visual demo content.

## Specifics

### transformVendor() Enhancements

Add transformation for:
- **certifications** array (with logo media transformation)
- **awards** array (with image media transformation)
- **socialProof** group
- **videoIntro** group (with thumbnail transformation)
- **caseStudies** array (with Lexical transformation and yacht relationships)
- **innovations** array (with Lexical transformation and image)
- **teamMembers** array (with photo transformation)
- **yachtProjects** array (with yacht relationships and image)

### transformProduct() Enhancements

Add transformation for:
- **comparisonMetrics** array
- **integrationCompatibility** group with nested arrays
- **ownerReviews** array (with Lexical transformation and yacht relationships)
- **visualDemoContent** group:
  - images360 array (with media transformation)
  - model3d group (with thumbnail transformation)
  - interactiveHotspots array (nested hotspots with media)
  - videoWalkthrough group (with thumbnail transformation)
  - augmentedRealityPreview group
- **technicalDocumentation** array
- **warrantySupport** group

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] transformVendor() handles all 8 enhanced sections
- [ ] transformProduct() handles all 6 enhanced sections
- [ ] All media paths transformed
- [ ] All Lexical rich text transformed
- [ ] All relationships resolved (yachts in case studies, reviews)
- [ ] Tests pass for enhanced field transformations
- [ ] No data loss in transformation

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Test certification logo transformation
- Test award image transformation
- Test case study Lexical transformation
- Test case study yacht relationship
- Test innovation Lexical transformation
- Test team member photo transformation
- Test yacht project relationship
- Test comparison metrics preservation
- Test owner review Lexical transformation
- Test owner review yacht relationship
- Test 360° image array transformation
- Test interactive hotspots nested structure
- Test video thumbnail transformation

## Evidence Required

**Code Files:**
1. Updated transformVendor() in `lib/payload-cms-data-service.ts`
2. Updated transformProduct() in `lib/payload-cms-data-service.ts`

**Test Results:**
- Unit tests passing for all enhanced field transformations
- Sample transformed vendor with certifications, awards, case studies
- Sample transformed product with comparison metrics, reviews, visual demos

**Verification Checklist:**
- [ ] All vendor enhanced fields transformed
- [ ] All product enhanced fields transformed
- [ ] Nested arrays handled correctly (hotspots, protocols, chapters)
- [ ] All media paths transformed
- [ ] All Lexical content transformed
- [ ] All relationships resolved
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No TypeScript errors

## Context Requirements

**Technical Spec Sections:**
- Lines 28-184: Enhanced Vendor Fields
- Lines 194-380: Enhanced Product Fields

**Related Tasks:**
- impl-backend-vendor-enhance
- impl-backend-product-enhance
- impl-frontend-yacht-methods

## Quality Gates

- [ ] All enhanced fields from technical spec covered
- [ ] Transformation logic is type-safe
- [ ] Error handling for undefined/null enhanced fields
- [ ] All media transformed
- [ ] All Lexical transformed
- [ ] All relationships resolved
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No TypeScript errors

## Notes

- Enhanced fields may be undefined (not all vendors/products will have them)
- Handle missing data gracefully (empty arrays, undefined)
- Nested structures (interactive hotspots) require careful transformation
- Case studies and reviews link to yachts (ensure relationships resolve)
- 360° images need angle metadata preserved for frontend rendering
- Consider performance impact of large arrays (optimize if needed)

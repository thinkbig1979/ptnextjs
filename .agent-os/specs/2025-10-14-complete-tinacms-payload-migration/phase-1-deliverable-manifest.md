## Notes

- Phase 1 is foundational - all Phase 2-5 tasks depend on these design decisions
- Focus on maintaining zero breaking changes to page components
- Document any deviations from existing patterns with clear rationale
- Ensure all transformation functions have complete TypeScript signatures
- PayloadCMSDataService must maintain full API compatibility with TinaCMSDataService
- All 6 documents must be complete before proceeding to Phase 2

# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement multi-location support for vendor profiles, allowing Tier 2+ vendors to add and manage multiple office addresses through their dashboard. The headquarters (HQ) address remains visible for all tiers, while additional locations are tier-gated, appearing only in location-based search results and profile pages for Tier 2+ subscriptions.

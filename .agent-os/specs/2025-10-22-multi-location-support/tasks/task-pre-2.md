# Task: PRE-2 - Integration Strategy and Dependency Planning

## Task Metadata
- **Task ID**: PRE-2
- **Phase**: Phase 1 - Pre-Execution Analysis
- **Agent**: context-fetcher
- **Estimated Time**: 3-5 minutes
- **Dependencies**: PRE-1
- **Status**: [x] Complete

## Task Description
Based on codebase analysis, create detailed integration strategy that defines how multi-location support will integrate with existing code. Plan npm dependency installations, identify potential conflicts, and create integration approach for each component.

## Specifics
- **Dependencies to Plan**:
  - `react-leaflet@^4.2.1` - Interactive map component
  - `leaflet@^1.9.4` - Core mapping library
  - `@types/leaflet@^1.9.8` - TypeScript definitions

- **Key Requirements**:
  - Define integration points between new LocationsManagerCard and existing dashboard profile page
  - Plan how locations array will coexist with existing vendor fields during migration
  - Define strategy for updating PayloadCMSDataService to handle locations array
  - Plan public profile integration for new Locations tab
  - Identify any potential conflicts with existing code

- **Technical Details**:
  - Verify react-leaflet compatibility with existing React 18 version
  - Check if leaflet CSS needs special Next.js configuration
  - Plan for geocode.maps.co API integration (client-side vs. server-side)
  - Define migration strategy (backward compatibility during rollout)
  - Identify any existing dependencies that might conflict

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete list of npm packages to install with versions
- [ ] Integration strategy document covering all major components
- [ ] Migration strategy defined (old location field â†’ new locations array)
- [ ] Conflict resolution plan for any identified dependency or pattern conflicts
- [ ] Timeline/ordering for implementation tasks identified
- [ ] Risk mitigation strategies for each integration point

## Testing Requirements
- **Functional Testing**: Verify all dependencies are available on npm registry
- **Manual Verification**: Check for known issues with planned dependencies
- **Browser Testing**: N/A (planning only)
- **Error Testing**: Identify potential runtime conflicts or breaking changes

## Evidence Required
- Integration strategy document including:
  - Dependency installation commands with versions
  - Component integration diagrams showing data flow
  - Migration plan with backward compatibility approach
  - Risk assessment matrix with mitigation strategies
  - Task execution ordering recommendations
  - Code modification points with specific file paths and line numbers

## Context Requirements
- Findings from PRE-1 codebase analysis
- Technical spec at @.agent-os/specs/2025-10-22-multi-location-support/sub-specs/technical-spec.md
- package.json to check existing dependencies
- Next.js configuration to plan any necessary config changes

## Implementation Notes
- Prioritize backward compatibility during migration
- Plan for feature flags if phased rollout is needed
- Consider impact on static site generation build time
- Identify any Next.js configuration changes needed for Leaflet

## Quality Gates
- [ ] All dependencies verified to be compatible with existing stack
- [ ] Integration strategy addresses all components from technical spec
- [ ] Migration strategy preserves existing data
- [ ] Risk mitigation plans are specific and actionable

# Task: PRE-1 - Pre-Execution Codebase Analysis

## Task Metadata
- **Task ID**: PRE-1
- **Phase**: Phase 1 - Pre-Execution Analysis
- **Agent**: context-fetcher
- **Estimated Time**: 3-5 minutes
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Status**: [ ] Not Started

## Task Description
Perform comprehensive codebase analysis to understand existing vendor profile architecture, Payload CMS schema patterns, dashboard structure, and public profile layout before implementing multi-location support. This analysis ensures the implementation integrates seamlessly with existing patterns.

## Specifics
- **Files to Analyze**:
  - `/home/edwin/development/ptnextjs/payload.config.ts` - Payload CMS configuration and vendors collection schema
  - `/home/edwin/development/ptnextjs/lib/payload-cms-data-service.ts` - Data service layer patterns
  - `/home/edwin/development/ptnextjs/lib/types.ts` - Existing Vendor interface and type definitions
  - `/home/edwin/development/ptnextjs/app/dashboard/profile/page.tsx` - Dashboard profile page structure
  - `/home/edwin/development/ptnextjs/app/vendors/[slug]/page.tsx` - Public vendor profile page structure
  - `/home/edwin/development/ptnextjs/components/ui/` - Available shadcn/ui components

- **Key Requirements**:
  - Identify current vendor location field structure (single location vs. array)
  - Document existing tier field and tier-checking patterns
  - Map dashboard profile form architecture and state management
  - Map public vendor profile layout and tab structure
  - Catalog available shadcn/ui components (Card, Button, Input, Dialog, Badge, etc.)
  - Identify authentication/authorization patterns used in dashboard

- **Technical Details**:
  - Look for existing Payload CMS field access control patterns
  - Identify how vendor tier is stored and accessed
  - Document any existing map components or geocoding integrations
  - Identify form validation patterns (Zod, React Hook Form usage)
  - Check for SWR or other data fetching library usage

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete inventory of current vendors collection schema documented
- [ ] Existing location field structure documented (field name, type, nested fields)
- [ ] Tier field location and possible values documented
- [ ] Dashboard profile page component hierarchy mapped
- [ ] Public vendor profile page structure and tab implementation documented
- [ ] List of available shadcn/ui components compiled
- [ ] Authentication patterns and route guards documented
- [ ] Data fetching patterns (SWR, server actions, etc.) documented

## Testing Requirements
- **Functional Testing**: Verify all analyzed files exist and are readable
- **Manual Verification**: Cross-check findings against CLAUDE.md and technical spec
- **Browser Testing**: N/A (analysis only)
- **Error Testing**: Identify missing or deprecated patterns that could cause issues

## Evidence Required
- Markdown document with comprehensive analysis findings including:
  - Current vendors schema structure with code snippets
  - Component hierarchy diagrams for dashboard and public profile pages
  - List of available UI components with import paths
  - Authentication/authorization patterns with code examples
  - Data fetching patterns with code examples
  - Any identified risks or integration challenges

## Context Requirements
- Access to full codebase
- Technical spec at @.agent-os/specs/2025-10-22-multi-location-support/sub-specs/technical-spec.md
- CLAUDE.md for architecture overview
- payload.config.ts for current schema patterns

## Implementation Notes
- Focus on understanding patterns, not creating implementation plans
- Document both frontend and backend integration points
- Identify any anti-patterns or deprecated code that should be avoided
- Note any missing dependencies that will need to be installed (react-leaflet, etc.)

## Quality Gates
- [ ] Analysis covers all files listed in "Files to Analyze"
- [ ] Findings are documented with specific code snippets and line numbers
- [ ] Integration risks and challenges identified
- [ ] Recommendations for seamless integration provided

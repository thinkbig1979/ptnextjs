<process_flow>

<step number="1" name="pre_upgrade_analysis">

### Step 1: Pre-Upgrade Analysis and Backup

Analyze the existing spec and create comprehensive backup before any modifications.

<spec_identification>
  **Identify Spec Location**:
  - User provides spec folder path: `specs/[spec-name]/`
  - OR user in spec directory already
  - OR user provides spec name to search for

  **Validation**:
  - [ ] Spec folder exists
  - [ ] Contains at minimum: spec.md or tasks.md
  - [ ] Valid Agent OS spec structure detected
</spec_identification>

<backup_creation>
  **Comprehensive Backup**:

  ACTION: Create backup directory
  LOCATION: `specs/[spec-name]/.backup-[timestamp]/`

  BACKUP FILES:
  - [ ] spec.md (if exists)
  - [ ] spec-lite.md (if exists)
  - [ ] technical-spec.md (if exists)
  - [ ] tasks.md (if exists)
  - [ ] tasks/ directory (if exists)
  - [ ] implementation-guide.md (if exists)
  - [ ] testing-strategy.md (if exists)
  - [ ] integration-requirements.md (if exists)
  - [ ] quality-gates.md (if exists)
  - [ ] architecture-decisions.md (if exists)
  - [ ] Any other .md files in spec folder

  RESULT: Complete snapshot for rollback if needed
</backup_creation>

<existing_content_analysis>
  **Analyze Current State**:

  READ and ANALYZE:
  - [ ] Main spec.md: Feature description, user stories, requirements
  - [ ] Technical spec (if exists): Implementation approach

  - [ ] Other spec files: Additional context and requirements

  EXTRACT:
  - **Feature Purpose**: What problem does this solve?
  - **User Stories**: Who is the user and what do they need?
  - **Current Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements
  - **Existing Technical Approach**: Architecture, tech choices, patterns
  - **Task Completion Status**: Which tasks are done/in-progress/blocked
  - **Implementation Notes**: Lessons learned, gotchas, decisions made

  IDENTIFY:
  - **Spec Version**: v1.0, v2.0, or custom format
  - **File Structure**: Monolithic, partial v2.0, or custom
  - **Completeness**: Missing files, incomplete sections
  - **Modernization Needs**: What needs updating for v2.1
</existing_content_analysis>

<instructions>
  ACTION: Create timestamp-based backup directory
  BACKUP: Copy all existing spec and task files

  REFERENCE: create-spec.md templates for v2.1 structure
  SYNTHESIZE: Original spec content + fresh codebase analysis
  ENHANCE: Apply latest standards and best practices
  VALIDATE: All 6 files complete and consistent
  GENERATE: spec-lite.md summary for quick reference
</instructions>

</step>

<step number="4" subagent="file-creator" name="regenerate_micro_granular_tasks">

### Step 4: Regenerate Micro-Granular Tasks with Split Structure

Generate comprehensive micro-granular task breakdown with optimized split file structure.

<task_regeneration_approach>
  **Task Generation Strategy**:

  INPUT: Newly regenerated 6-file spec structure
  APPLY: Codebase analysis from Step 2
  REFERENCE: create-tasks.md micro-granular templates
  PRESERVE: Task completion status from original tasks.md

  **Status Preservation Logic**:
  - IF original task exists with same purpose: Keep [x] completed status
  - IF task is new or significantly different: Mark [ ] incomplete
  - COPY implementation notes from completed tasks
  - PRESERVE lessons learned and gotchas
</task_regeneration_approach>

<task_generation_process>
  **Use file-creator subagent to generate**:

  REFERENCE: @.agent-os/instructions/core/create-tasks.md templates
  APPLY: Micro-granular task decomposition
  IMPLEMENT: Split task file structure

  **Phase 1: Pre-Execution Analysis Tasks**
  - Codebase analysis (mark [x] if already done)
  - Integration strategy creation
  - Context package preparation

  **Phase 2: Backend Implementation Tasks** (if backend required)
  - Backend test design
  - Database schema and migrations
  - API endpoint implementation
  - Business logic and validation
  - Backend integration testing

  **Phase 3: Frontend Implementation Tasks** (if frontend required)
  - Component library setup
  - Navigation architecture implementation
  - Page layout implementation
  - UI component implementation per Component Architecture
  - State management implementation
  - User flow implementation per User Flow patterns
  - Frontend integration testing

  **Phase 4: Full-Stack Integration Tasks** (if both frontend and backend)
  - API contract validation
  - Frontend-backend integration
  - End-to-end user workflow testing

  **Phase 5: System Integration Tasks**
  - Cross-component integration
  - End-to-end validation
  - Final quality assurance

  **Output Structure**:
  ```
  specs/[spec-name]/
  ├── tasks.md              # Lightweight master (50-100 lines)
  └── tasks/                # Individual task detail files
      ├── task-pre-1.md
      ├── task-pre-2.md
      ├── task-impl-1.md
      └── ...
  ```
</task_generation_process>

<micro_granular_quality>
  **Task Quality Requirements**:

  ✅ **Specificity**: Each task has exact file paths, function signatures
  ✅ **Context**: Each task includes sufficient context for autonomous execution
  ✅ **Dependencies**: Clear dependency mapping with parallel execution opportunities
  ✅ **Validation**: Embedded quality gates and acceptance criteria
  ✅ **Testing**: Comprehensive testing requirements per task
  ✅ **Evidence**: Clear evidence collection specifications

  **Agent Optimization**:
  - Tasks assigned to specialist agents (test-architect, implementation-specialist, etc.)
  - Context packages optimized per agent type
  - Parallel execution streams identified
  - Dependency coordination planned
</micro_granular_quality>

<status_migration>
  **Preserve Work Done**:

  ANALYZE: Original tasks.md for completed tasks

  FOR each completed task in original:
    IDENTIFY: Corresponding task in new breakdown
    IF exact match OR similar purpose:
      MARK: New task as [x] completed
      COPY: Implementation notes and lessons learned
      ADD: "Migrated from original spec - work preserved"
    ELSE:
      MARK: [ ] incomplete (significantly changed)
      ADD: "Re-evaluation needed - requirements changed"

  RESULT: Credit for completed work while ensuring quality
</status_migration>

<instructions>
  ACTION: Use file-creator for micro-granular task generation
  REFERENCE: create-tasks.md v2.0 templates
  GENERATE: Master tasks.md + individual task detail files
  PRESERVE: Task completion status from original spec
  OPTIMIZE: Split structure for 90%+ context reduction
  VALIDATE: Task count appropriate, dependencies clear

<comparison_with_enhance_existing>

## Upgrade-Spec vs Enhance-Existing

**Use `upgrade-spec` when**:
- ✅ You want to fully modernize an old spec to v2.1 standards
- ✅ You need fresh codebase analysis and integration intelligence
- ✅ You want the 6-file comprehensive spec structure
- ✅ You want micro-granular task regeneration
- ✅ You want optimized split task file structure
- ✅ Spec is significantly outdated (v1.0 or early v2.0)

**Use `enhance-existing` when**:
- ✅ You just want to add validation requirements
- ✅ Spec structure is already good, just needs validation gates
- ✅ You want to preserve exact existing content structure
- ✅ You only need task structure migration (monolithic → split)
- ✅ Spec is recent and follows good patterns

**Key Differences**:
- `upgrade-spec`: **Full re-evaluation and regeneration**
- `enhance-existing`: **Additive enhancements only**

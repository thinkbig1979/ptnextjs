# Context Optimization Integration

## Overview

This document defines how the context-optimizer agent integrates with the task-orchestrator to provide intelligent context distribution across specialist agents during orchestrated task execution.

## Integration Architecture

### 1. Context Optimization Workflow
```yaml
context_optimization_workflow:
  phase_1_analysis:
    task_context_requirements:
      - Analyze parent task and all subtasks for context needs
      - Map subtasks to specialist agent context requirements
      - Identify shared context vs. agent-specific context
      - Calculate total context requirements vs. available capacity

    domain_classification:
      - Categorize task components by domain (frontend, backend, testing, etc.)
      - Identify cross-domain dependencies and interactions
      - Map domains to specialist agent capabilities
      - Assess context overlap and optimization opportunities

  phase_2_optimization:
    context_filtering_and_prioritization:
      - Apply semantic filtering to relevant documentation sections
      - Prioritize context based on task criticality and agent needs
      - Eliminate redundant and outdated information
      - Create hierarchical context organization

    allocation_strategy_development:
      - Calculate optimal context window allocation per agent
      - Balance context depth vs. breadth based on task complexity
      - Plan context refresh and update strategies
      - Design fallback allocation for context overflow scenarios

  phase_3_distribution:
    agent_specific_packaging:
      - Create focused context packages for each specialist agent
      - Include shared context references and coordination information
      - Package context with clear structure and navigation
      - Include context metadata and usage guidelines

    intelligent_delivery:
      - Distribute context to agents based on execution timeline
      - Implement progressive context loading for large tasks
      - Provide context updates and refinements during execution
      - Monitor context utilization and adjust as needed
```

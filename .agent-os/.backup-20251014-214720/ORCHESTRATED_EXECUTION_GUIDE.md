## Getting Started

### 1. Configuration
Ensure your `config.yml` has orchestration enabled:
```yaml

```

### 2. Using Orchestrated Execution
The orchestrated execution is automatically used when executing tasks through the standard Agent OS commands:

```bash
# Execute tasks with orchestrated parallel processing
/commands/execute-tasks.md
```

### 3. Monitoring and Feedback
The system provides real-time feedback on:
- Agent coordination and progress
- Context optimization effectiveness
- Error detection and recovery

## Deliverable Verification Framework

### Critical Importance

**Problem Solved**: Orchestrators previously marked tasks complete without verifying subagents actually delivered the required files, leading to missing implementations.

**Solution**: Mandatory deliverable tracking and verification at every step of orchestration.

### Verification Workflow

```yaml
deliverable_verification_workflow:
  phase_1_pre_delegation:
    deliverable_manifest_creation:
      - Analyze task requirements and acceptance criteria
      - Identify ALL files to be created or modified
      - Document verification criteria for each file
      - List test files required with coverage expectations
      - Plan integration verification points
      - Share manifest with all subagents before work begins

    manifest_components:
      - Files to be created with requirements
      - Files to be modified with expected changes
      - Test files with coverage expectations
      - Acceptance criteria with evidence requirements

        - BLOCK completion if content insufficient

      test_verification:
        - Verify ALL test files exist using Read tool
        - Use test-runner to execute ALL tests
        - Confirm 100% of tests pass
        - Check test coverage meets threshold (80%+)
        - BLOCK completion if tests missing or failing

      acceptance_criteria_evidence:
        - Review each acceptance criterion
        - Verify evidence exists for each
        - Request additional evidence if missing
        - Validate evidence proves criterion met
        - BLOCK completion if criteria unverified

      integration_verification:
        - Check integration points between components
        - Verify APIs match between frontend/backend
        - Ensure no missing dependencies or imports
        - Validate end-to-end data flow
        - BLOCK completion if integration broken

  phase_4_completion_decision:
    approval_criteria:
      - ALL files verified to exist
      - Content validated to meet requirements
      - ALL tests exist and pass (100%)
      - Test coverage meets minimum threshold
      - Acceptance criteria verified with evidence
      - Integration points verified and working

    blocking_scenarios:
      missing_files: "Request subagent create immediately"
      failing_tests: "Request fix from test or implementation specialist"
      missing_evidence: "Request subagents provide proof"
      integration_broken: "Request coordination between subagents"

    only_after_verification:

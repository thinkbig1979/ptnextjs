- ✅ **Specialist agent coordination** for testing, implementation, integration, quality, security, documentation
- ✅ **Advanced error handling** with automatic recovery and intelligent escalation
- ✅ **Context optimization** for maximum efficiency and relevance
- ✅ **Mandatory deliverable verification** (v2.5+) - all files verified before task completion
- ✅ **100% file verification** using Read tool for all expected deliverables
- ✅ **Test execution validation** ensuring all tests pass
- ✅ **Acceptance criteria evidence** with tangible proof of completion

**Use this when:** Implementing tasks from a task list created by create-tasks.

**Use validate-spec after:** To validate implementation quality and completeness.

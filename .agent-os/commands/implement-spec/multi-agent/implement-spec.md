# Implement Spec

Execute specifications using orchestrated parallel execution for maximum efficiency and quality.

## Multi-Agent Mode

This command leverages Agent OS v2.5+ orchestrated parallel execution to implement specifications 60-80% faster through specialist agent coordination.

### Usage

Execute product specifications with intelligent parallel processing:
- Orchestrates specialist agents working on different aspects simultaneously
- Manages task dependencies and inter-agent communication
- Provides advanced error handling and automatic recovery
- Ensures deliverable verification before task completion

### Execution

Refer to the instructions located in this file:
@.agent-os/instructions/core/implement-spec.md

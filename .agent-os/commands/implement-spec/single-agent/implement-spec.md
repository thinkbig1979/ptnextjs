# Implement Spec

Execute specifications using a streamlined single-agent workflow for focused implementation.

## Single-Agent Mode

This command provides a sequential, single-agent approach to implementing specifications with full control over the development process.

### Usage

Execute product specifications with a focused workflow:
- Implement features sequentially with clear progress tracking
- Manage task dependencies manually with full visibility
- Handle errors directly with immediate intervention capability
- Validate deliverables at each implementation milestone

### Execution

Refer to the instructions located in this file:
@.agent-os/instructions/core/implement-spec-single-agent.md

### Single-Agent Workflow

This command follows a structured sequential approach:

1. **Task Analysis**: Review and understand specification requirements
2. **Implementation Planning**: Create step-by-step implementation plan
3. **Core Development**: Implement primary features and functionality
4. **Testing Integration**: Develop and run tests for implemented features
5. **Quality Validation**: Review code quality and standards compliance
6. **Documentation**: Create necessary technical documentation
7. **Integration Testing**: Verify all components work together correctly

### Implementation Strategy

**Sequential Development**:
- Focus on one component at a time for maximum clarity
- Build incrementally with regular validation checkpoints
- Maintain full control over implementation decisions
- Direct oversight of code quality and architecture

**Error Handling**:
- Immediate visibility of any issues that arise
- Direct control over resolution strategies
- No dependency on external coordination or recovery systems
- Full context preservation throughout implementation

### When to Use Single-Agent Mode

- **Small to medium projects** where complexity is manageable
- **Learning environments** where understanding the full process is valuable
- **Resource-constrained situations** where parallel execution isn't feasible
- **Highly specialized requirements** needing focused expertise
- **Prototype development** where rapid iteration is prioritized

### Profile Support

Different profiles provide specialized implementation approaches:

- **default**: Standard full-stack implementation workflow
- **fullstack**: Comprehensive frontend and backend coordination
- **frontend**: Frontend-focused implementation with React/Vue specialization
- **backend**: Backend and API-focused implementation with database expertise

### Benefits of Single-Agent Mode

- **Complete control** over every implementation decision
- **Full context awareness** throughout the entire process
- **Simplified debugging** with direct access to all implementation details
- **Flexible adaptation** to changing requirements during development
- **Transparent progress tracking** with clear milestone achievements

### Quality Assurance

While using single-agent mode, maintain quality through:
- Regular code reviews at each implementation stage
- Comprehensive testing before moving to next components
- Documentation updates alongside implementation
- Standards compliance checking throughout development
- Integration validation after each major feature completion

# Validate Spec

Comprehensive validation of specifications, implementations, and deliverables using a focused single-agent workflow.

## Single-Agent Mode

This command provides a systematic, single-agent approach to validation with complete control over the validation process and direct oversight of all quality aspects.

### Usage

Execute comprehensive validation with a structured sequential workflow:
- **Specification Validation**: Completeness, technical depth, implementation readiness
- **Browser Testing**: Frontend functionality, accessibility, responsive design  
- **System Validation**: Integration, performance, security, architecture
- **Quality Assurance**: Code quality, standards compliance, documentation

### Execution

Refer to the instructions located in this file:
@.agent-os/instructions/core/validate-spec-single-agent.md

### Single-Agent Validation Workflow

This command follows a structured sequential approach:

#### 1. Validation Planning and Scoping
- Identify validation targets and scope
- Determine validation priorities based on project context
- Plan validation sequence and resource allocation
- Set quality thresholds and success criteria

#### 2. Specification Quality Validation
- **Completeness Assessment**: Verify all required sections and files
- **Technical Depth Analysis**: Evaluate implementation detail and code examples
- **Implementation Readiness**: Check clarity of requirements and specifications
- **Documentation Quality**: Assess explanations, diagrams, and examples

#### 3. Implementation Quality Validation
- **Code Quality Review**: Style consistency, complexity, maintainability
- **Test Coverage Analysis**: Unit tests, integration tests, edge cases
- **Performance Evaluation**: Efficiency, scalability, resource usage
- **Security Assessment**: Vulnerability analysis and best practices

#### 4. System Integration Validation
- **Component Integration**: Verify compatibility and data flow
- **API Validation**: Test endpoints, contracts, and error handling
- **Database Integration**: Validate queries, migrations, performance
- **End-to-End Workflows**: Test complete user journeys

#### 5. Browser and Frontend Validation
- **Functionality Testing**: Component behavior and user interactions
- **Responsive Design**: Test across different screen sizes and devices
- **Accessibility Audit**: WCAG compliance and usability testing
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Test across major browsers

#### 6. Quality Gate Validation
- **Threshold Compliance**: Verify all quality standards are met
- **Issue Prioritization**: Rank identified issues by severity and impact
- **Improvement Recommendations**: Provide specific actionable guidance
- **Sign-off Decision**: Determine readiness for next development phase

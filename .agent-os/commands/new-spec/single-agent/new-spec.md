Plan a new product or analyze an existing product and create comprehensive specifications.

## Single-Agent Mode

This command provides a streamlined, single-agent workflow for product analysis and specification creation.

### Usage

For new products:
- Analyzes product vision and requirements
- Creates comprehensive product specifications
- Sets up Agent OS in the codebase
- Generates task lists for implementation

For existing products:
- Analyzes current codebase structure
- Identifies areas for enhancement
- Creates upgrade specifications
- Plans migration strategies

### Execution

Refer to the instructions located in this file:

### Single-Agent Workflow

This command follows a sequential approach:
1. **Product Analysis**: Gather requirements and analyze existing codebase
2. **Specification Creation**: Write detailed technical specifications
3. **Task Generation**: Create executable task lists
4. **Quality Validation**: Review and validate specification completeness

### Profile Support

Different profiles provide specialized approaches:
- **default**: Standard product specification workflow
- **fullstack**: Full-stack application specification focus
- **frontend**: Frontend-heavy application specialization  
- **backend**: Backend and API-focused specifications

### When to Use Single-Agent Mode

- Smaller projects with straightforward requirements
- Quick prototyping and initial specification drafts
- Resource-constrained environments
- When you prefer direct control over the specification process

| No 404 errors on any routes | ✅ | All pages build and render correctly |
| TinaCMS admin works with new structure | ✅ | Configuration updated and validated |
| Production build succeeds | ✅ | Clean build with 0 errors/warnings |
| All existing functionality preserved | ✅ | Partners/vendors distinction maintained |

## Error Scenarios Tested

### Invalid References
- ✅ Tested invalid vendor slugs → Return 404 as expected
- ✅ Tested invalid product IDs → Return 404 as expected  
- ✅ No broken references found in content

### Build Validation
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Static generation for all pages successful
- ✅ No runtime errors during build process

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions: None Required
The migration is complete and functioning correctly.

### Future Considerations
1. **Content Updates**: New vendors should be added to `content/vendors/`
2. **Media Assets**: Use `/media/vendors/` for new vendor media
3. **Documentation**: Update any internal docs to reference new paths

# Upgrade Spec to v3.3.0 Standards

## Overview

Fully modernize existing Agent OS specifications to v3.3.0 standards through comprehensive re-evaluation, codebase analysis, and regeneration of all spec and task files.

This command performs a **complete upgrade** including:
- 6-file comprehensive spec structure
- Fresh codebase analysis and integration intelligence
- Micro-granular task regeneration
- Optimized split task file structure (90%+ context reduction)
- Test context gathering with library documentation (v3.1+)
- Skills integration for pattern lookup (v3.2+)
- Test execution monitoring with streaming reporters (v3.3.0+)
- Test/code alignment validation (v3.3.0+)

**Use this when:** You want to fully modernize an old spec to current standards.

**Use enhance-existing when:** You just want to add validation requirements to existing content.

# Create Tasks

## Overview

Break down feature specifications into micro-granular, executable tasks with optimized file structure. This command creates:
- ✅ Optimized split task file structure (90%+ context reduction)
- ✅ Lightweight master tasks.md for quick overview
- ✅ Individual task detail files (tasks/task-*.md)
- ✅ Micro-granular tasks (1-4 hours each)
- ✅ Clear dependency chains and execution order
- ✅ Specialized agent assignments (task-orchestrator, implementation-architect, etc.)

**Use this when:** You have a completed spec and need to create executable tasks.

**Use execute-tasks after:** To implement the tasks using orchestrated parallel execution.

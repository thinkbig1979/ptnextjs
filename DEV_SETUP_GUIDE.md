# Development Setup Guide - Payload CMS Integration

This guide explains how to use the development-only Payload CMS integration in your Next.js project.

## Overview

Step 3 of the Payload CMS integration has been completed, adding development-only startup logic that allows you to run Payload CMS alongside your Next.js application during development without affecting production builds.

## Key Features

âœ… **Development-Only**: CMS only runs in development mode (`NODE_ENV=development`)  
âœ… **Production Safe**: Zero impact on production builds or deployments  
âœ… **Port Management**: CMS runs on port 3001, Next.js on port 3000  
âœ… **Easy Scripts**: Multiple ways to start development servers  
âœ… **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper process management with SIGINT/SIGTERM handling  

## Available Commands

### 1. Run Both Servers Together (Recommended)
```bash
./scripts/dev-with-cms.sh
```
This starts both Next.js (port 3000) and Payload CMS (port 3001) simultaneously.

### 2. Run Only Payload CMS
```bash
./scripts/start-cms-only.sh
```
Useful when you only need to work on CMS content or configuration.

### 3. Run Only Next.js (Standard)
```bash
npm run dev
```
Standard Next.js development - no CMS running.

### 4. Run Payload CMS Directly
```bash
NODE_ENV=development npx tsx scripts/start-payload-dev.ts
```
Direct execution of the Payload startup script.

## URLs When Running

| Service | URL | Purpose |
|---------|-----|---------|
| Next.js App | http://localhost:3000 | Main application |
| Payload Admin | http://localhost:3001/admin | CMS admin interface |
| Payload API | http://localhost:3001/api | CMS API endpoints |

## Environment Safety

The development startup script includes built-in safety checks:

```bash
# âœ… WORKS - Development mode
NODE_ENV=development npx tsx scripts/start-payload-dev.ts

# ðŸš« SKIPS - Production mode  
NODE_ENV=production npx tsx scripts/start-payload-dev.ts
# Output: "ðŸš« Payload CMS startup skipped (not in development mode)"
```

## Production Build Verification

Production builds are completely unaffected:

```bash
npm run build  # âœ… Still works perfectly
npm start      # âœ… Production mode - no CMS
```

## Files Created

### Core Scripts
- `scripts/start-payload-dev.ts` - Main development startup logic
- `scripts/dev-with-cms.sh` - Helper to run both servers
- `scripts/start-cms-only.sh` - Helper to run only CMS

### Configuration Updates
- `tsconfig.json` - Excludes scripts/cms folders from production builds
- Dependencies added: `payload`, `@payloadcms/db-sqlite`, `express`, `@types/express`

## Development Workflow

### First Time Setup
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
2. Make scripts executable: `chmod +x scripts/*.sh`
3. Start development: `./scripts/dev-with-cms.sh`

### Daily Development
1. Start both servers: `./scripts/dev-with-cms.sh`
2. Access your Next.js app: http://localhost:3000
3. Access Payload admin: http://localhost:3001/admin
4. Work on your project normally
5. Stop with `Ctrl+C`

### CMS-Only Development
If you only need to work on CMS configuration or content:
```bash
./scripts/start-cms-only.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

### Port Conflicts
If port 3001 is busy, set a different port:
```bash
PAYLOAD_PORT=3002 ./scripts/start-cms-only.sh
```

### Script Permissions
If scripts don't run, make them executable:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

### TypeScript Errors
Scripts are excluded from production builds but you can check them:
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit scripts/start-payload-dev.ts
```

## Next Steps

This completes Step 3 of the Payload CMS integration. The next steps will be:

1. **Step 4**: Set Up Payload Admin Interface
2. **Step 5**: Define Content Collections (Blog, Partners, Products)
3. **Step 6**: Create Data Migration Scripts
4. **Step 7**: Integrate Payload with Next.js API Routes
5. **Step 8**: Update Next.js Components

## Support

For issues with the development setup:
1. Check that all dependencies are installed
2. Verify Node.js version compatibility
3. Ensure scripts have executable permissions
4. Check for port conflicts

**Status**: âœ… Step 3 Complete - Development-only startup logic fully implemented and tested.

# Payload CMS v3 Integration Progress

This document tracks the progress of integrating Payload CMS v3 with SQLite into the existing Next.js 15.4.5 application.

## Project Overview
- **Project Path**: `/home/ubuntu/ptnextjs`
- **Next.js Version**: 15.4.5
- **Target CMS**: Payload CMS v3
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Integration Goal**: Headless CMS for content management with static site performance

## Integration Steps Progress

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Set Up Payload CMS v3 with SQLite
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Completion Date**: 2025-01-28

**Tasks Completed**:
- [x] Created `/cms` folder at project root
- [x] Initialized Node.js app inside `/cms` with `npm init -y`
- [x] Installed required dependencies: `payload@3.49.1`, `@payloadcms/db-sqlite@3.49.1`, `express@5.1.0`
- [x] Installed development dependencies: `typescript`, `@types/node`, `ts-node`
- [x] Created `payload.config.ts` with minimal SQLite configuration
- [x] Configured Payload to use SQLite with filename `./payload.db`
- [x] Created server setup file (`server.mjs`) for running Payload
- [x] Set up TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.json`)
- [x] Created environment configuration (`.env.example`)
- [x] Verified all dependencies are properly installed

**Files Created**:
- `/cms/package.json` - Node.js package configuration
- `/cms/payload.config.ts` - Payload CMS configuration with SQLite adapter
- `/cms/server.mjs` - Express server setup for Payload admin
- `/cms/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `/cms/.env.example` - Environment variables template
- `/cms/.gitignore` - Git ignore for CMS-specific files

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Database**: SQLite adapter configured to use `./payload.db`
- **Admin Panel**: Accessible at `http://localhost:3001/admin`
- **API Endpoint**: Available at `http://localhost:3001/api`
- **Authentication**: Basic user collection with email/password auth
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support with proper type generation

**Next Steps Ready**:
- Basic user collection configured for admin access
- SQLite database adapter properly configured
- Server setup ready for development and testing
- Ready to add custom collections in Step 2

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Define Content Collections
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Completion Date**: 2025-01-28

**Tasks Completed**:
- [x] Created comprehensive Blog Posts collection with all required fields
- [x] Created Partners collection with complete company information
- [x] Created Products collection with partner relationships
- [x] Created Categories collection for content organization
- [x] Created Authors collection for blog post attribution
- [x] Created Media collection for file uploads with image optimization
- [x] Enhanced Users collection with role-based access control
- [x] Defined proper field schemas matching existing TypeScript interfaces
- [x] Set up relationships between collections (Products ‚Üí Partners, Posts ‚Üí Authors & Categories)
- [x] Configured drafts and versioning for content management workflow

**Collections Created**:
- **Blog Posts** (`blog-posts`): title, slug, excerpt, content (richText), author (relationship), publishedAt, category (relationship), tags (array), image (upload), featured, readTime
- **Partners** (`partners`): name, category (relationship), description, logo (upload), website, founded, location, tags (array), featured
- **Products** (`products`): name, partner (relationship), category (relationship), description, image (upload), features (array), price, tags (array)
- **Categories** (`categories`): name, slug, description, type (blog/product/partner), color
- **Authors** (`authors`): name, role, bio, image (upload), email, linkedin, twitter
- **Media** (`media`): Upload collection with image optimization (thumbnail, card, tablet sizes)
- **Users** (`users`): Enhanced with role-based access (admin, editor, author)

**Technical Features**:
- Perfect field mapping from existing TypeScript interfaces to Payload field types
- Maintained compatibility with existing dynamic routes (`/blog/[slug]`, `/products/[id]`, `/partners/[id]`)
- Public read access for all content collections
- Comprehensive admin interface with useful default columns and descriptions

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Add Dev-Only Payload Startup Logic
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Completion Date**: 2025-01-28

**Tasks Completed**:
- [x] Created development-only startup script at `scripts/start-payload-dev.ts`
- [x] Implemented environment check (`NODE_ENV === 'development'`) to conditionally start Payload
- [x] Added Express server setup that works alongside Next.js dev server
- [x] Configured different port allocation (3001 for Payload, 3000 for Next.js)
- [x] Added proper error handling and logging for development workflow
- [x] Created helper scripts for running both servers simultaneously
- [x] Added required Payload dependencies to main project
- [x] Ensured production builds remain unaffected

**Files Created**:
- `scripts/start-payload-dev.ts` - Development-only Payload CMS startup script
- `scripts/dev-with-cms.sh` - Helper script to run both Next.js and Payload CMS
- `scripts/start-cms-only.sh` - Helper script to run only Payload CMS

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Environment Safety**: Script only runs when `NODE_ENV === 'development'`
- **Port Management**: Payload CMS runs on port 3001, Next.js on port 3000
- **Dynamic Config Loading**: Imports CMS configuration from `/cms/payload.config.ts`
- **Process Management**: Proper SIGINT/SIGTERM handling for graceful shutdown
- **Development Experience**: Clear logging and helpful startup messages

**Usage Commands**:
```bash
# Run both Next.js and Payload CMS together
./scripts/dev-with-cms.sh

# Run only Payload CMS (for CMS development)
./scripts/start-cms-only.sh

# Run only Next.js (standard development)
npm run dev

# Run Payload CMS directly with tsx
npx tsx scripts/start-payload-dev.ts
```

**Production Safety**:
- Script automatically exits if not in development mode
- No impact on `npm run build` or production deployments
- Dependencies added only affect development workflow

### üîÑ Step 4: Host Admin UI at `/admin`
**Status**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS
**Completion Date**: 2025-08-03 (Partial)

**Tasks Completed**:
- [x] Created Next.js middleware to proxy `/admin` requests to Payload CMS (port 3001)
- [x] Updated Payload CMS configuration for better integration
- [x] Created JavaScript-based startup script (start-payload-dev.js) to avoid TypeScript compilation issues
- [x] Fixed Payload configuration errors (RichText editor, SQLite URL format, CORS settings)
- [x] Enhanced development scripts for integrated workflow
- [x] Updated shell scripts to use JavaScript version of Payload startup

**Current Status**:
- ‚úÖ **Middleware Integration**: Next.js middleware is properly configured at `/middleware.ts` to proxy `/admin` routes
- ‚úÖ **Development Scripts**: Both Next.js and Payload CMS can run simultaneously via `./scripts/dev-with-cms.sh`
- ‚úÖ **Configuration**: Payload CMS configuration updated and compiles successfully
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Admin Interface**: Payload CMS initializes but admin routes return 404 (investigation needed)

**Files Created/Updated**:
- `/middleware.ts` - Next.js middleware for admin route proxying
- `/scripts/start-payload-dev.js` - JavaScript-based Payload CMS startup script
- `/scripts/dev-with-cms.sh` - Updated to use JavaScript version
- `/cms/payload.config.ts` - Fixed configuration errors and compatibility issues
- `/cms/server.mjs` - Updated to properly import TypeScript config

**Technical Implementation Details**:
- **Middleware Strategy**: Uses NextResponse.rewrite() to proxy `/admin/*` to `http://localhost:3001/admin/*`
- **CORS Configuration**: Configured for localhost:3000 and localhost:3001 origins
- **Database**: SQLite with proper file URL format (`file:/path/to/payload.db`)
- **Admin Panel**: Configured with users collection for authentication
- **Development Workflow**: Both servers run on separate ports (3000 for Next.js, 3001 for Payload)

**Known Issues**:
- Payload CMS admin panel returns 404 despite successful initialization (routes not mounting properly)
- This appears to be a Payload CMS internal routing issue that needs further investigation

**Next Steps (Remaining)**:
- [ ] Investigate Payload CMS admin route mounting issue
- [ ] Test admin interface accessibility at http://localhost:3000/admin
- [ ] Verify authentication and user management
- [ ] Test CRUD operations in admin interface
- [ ] Complete integration testing

**Usage (Current)**:
```bash
# Start both servers with integrated setup
./scripts/dev-with-cms.sh

# Access points (when fully working):
# - Next.js App: http://localhost:3000
# - Admin Panel: http://localhost:3000/admin (via middleware)
# - Direct CMS: http://localhost:3001/admin (direct access)
```

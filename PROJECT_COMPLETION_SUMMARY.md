## 📊 Project Overview

Successfully completed the comprehensive refactoring of the existing "Partners" terminology to "Vendors" with advanced filtering capabilities and new page structures. The system now supports both Partners (`partner: true`) and future Suppliers (`partner: false`) with sophisticated display logic.

## ✅ Phase Completion Summary

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Data Model Updates** ✅
- **Duration:** Completed

  - Updated TypeScript types from Partner to Vendor with backward compatibility
  - Created comprehensive vendor data service methods with filtering support
  - Maintained full backward compatibility for existing Partner APIs
  - All builds successful, zero breaking changes

### **Phase 2: CMS Configuration Updates** ✅
- **Duration:** Completed (integrated with Phase 1)
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Collection renamed to "vendor" with label "Vendors" in TinaCMS admin
  - `partner` boolean field properly configured with clear labeling
  - Product collection updated to reference vendors
  - All TinaCMS admin interface terminology updated

### **Phase 3: Create New Vendors Page** ✅
- **Duration:** Completed
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - New `/vendors` route showing ALL vendors (both partners and future suppliers)
  - Reusable VendorCard component for consistent vendor display
  - Shared VendorsClient component with partner filtering capability
  - Individual vendor detail pages at `/vendors/[slug]`
  - Updated main navigation with "Vendors" link

### **Phase 4: Update Partners Page Logic** ✅
- **Duration:** Completed (integrated with Phase 3)
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Partners page now uses shared components with `showPartnersOnly={true}` flag
  - Shows only vendors where `partner == true`
  - Full backward compatibility maintained with existing URLs

### **Phase 5: Homepage Vendor Filtering** ✅
- **Duration:** Completed
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Homepage updated to show only featured partners (`featured == true AND partner == true`)
  - Added optimized `getFeaturedPartners()` method with dedicated caching
  - Improved performance with compound filtering logic
  - Ready to exclude featured suppliers when added

### **Phase 6: Products Page Toggle Implementation** ✅
- **Duration:** Completed
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - VendorToggle component with professional horizontal switch design
  - "Partner Products" vs "All Vendors" filtering on products page
  - URL state management with bookmarkable filter states (`?view=all`)
  - Optimized filtering performance with vendor lookup maps
  - Default state: "Partner Products" showing only partner products
  - Full backward compatibility with all existing features

## 🎯 Current System Capabilities

### **Display Logic Implementation**
| Page | Show Criteria | Current Results |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| **Homepage** | `featured == true AND partner == true` | ✅ 4 featured partners |
| **Partners Page** (`/partners`) | `partner == true` | ✅ 19 partners |
| **Vendors Page** (`/vendors`) | ALL vendors | ✅ 19 vendors (all currently partners) |
| **Products Page** (Partner Toggle) | `vendor.partner == true` | ✅ Partner products only |
| **Products Page** (All Toggle) | ALL products | ✅ All vendor products |

### **URL Structure**
- ✅ `/` - Homepage (4 featured partners)
- ✅ `/partners` - Partners page (19 partners)
- ✅ `/vendors` - New vendors page (all 19 vendors)
- ✅ `/products` - Products with toggle (default: partner products)
- ✅ `/products?view=all` - Products showing all vendors
- ✅ `/partners/[slug]` - Individual partner detail pages (19 pages)
- ✅ `/vendors/[slug]` - Individual vendor detail pages (19 pages)
- ✅ `/products/[id]` - Individual product pages (37 pages)

# STEP 6: Payload CMS Isolation Configuration
# ============================================
# Complete architectural separation between Next.js and Payload CMS

# Next.js Configuration (Port 3000)
NODE_ENV=development

# Payload CMS Isolated Service Configuration (Port 3001) 
PAYLOAD_SECRET=your-secret-here-development
DATABASE_URL=file:./payload.db
USE_PAYLOAD_CMS=true

# Isolated API Communication Settings
PAYLOAD_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
PAYLOAD_CMS_HOST=localhost
PAYLOAD_CMS_PORT=3001

# Architecture Notes:
# - Next.js: Independent service on port 3000
# - Payload CMS: Independent service on port 3001
# - Communication: HTTP API calls (no routing proxying)
# - Admin Access: Direct to http://localhost:3001/admin
# - CMS API Access: Direct to http://localhost:3001/api

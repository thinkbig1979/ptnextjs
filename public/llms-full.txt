## About

Paul Thames is a specialist consultancy serving the superyacht industry, founded by Edwin Edelenbos and Roel van der Zwet. The company bridges the gap between technology suppliers and superyacht projects, offering technical credibility, commercial structure, and market access. Services span from hands-on project advisory for owners, designers, and shipyards to market entry support for technology manufacturers, alongside bespoke lighting design for superyachts and architectural spaces.

### Why Paul Thames Exists

After years working across shipyards, integrators, and technology suppliers, the founders kept seeing the same pattern: projects struggling not because the technology was wrong, but because the right expertise wasn't connected to the right people at the right time. Owners' teams needed independent guidance. Shipyards needed specialists they could trust. Suppliers needed access to decision-makers. Paul Thames exists to reduce that friction, bringing technical credibility, commercial relationships, and enough experience to know what actually works in superyacht projects.

- **Industry Relationships**: Established connections across shipyards, integrators, suppliers, and owners' teams built over decades.
- **Commercial Clarity**: Understanding of what it takes to succeed in this market, from positioning to pricing to reaching the right people.

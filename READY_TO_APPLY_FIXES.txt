AUTHENTICATION FIXES - READY TO APPLY

Status: All fixes are prepared and ready to apply

Files prepared:
✓ seed-route-fixed.ts - Corrected seed API (removed double hashing)
✓ do-fix.sh - Shell script to apply all fixes
✓ manual-test-login.sh - Manual testing script
✓ AUTH_FIX_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md - Complete implementation documentation

To apply the fixes, run:
  bash /home/edwin/development/ptnextjs/do-fix.sh

This will:
1. Copy seed-route-fixed.ts → app/api/test/vendors/seed/route.ts
2. Update app/api/auth/login/route.ts with debugging

Then verify with:
  bash /home/edwin/development/ptnextjs/manual-test-login.sh

And run E2E tests:
  npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/vendor-onboarding/03-authentication.spec.ts

Root causes fixed:
- Double password hashing in seed API
- Added debugging to login endpoint
- Documented registration endpoint (no fixes needed)

Expected impact:
- Login tests: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 should PASS
- Overall test pass rate: from 37.5% to 50%+
